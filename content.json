It contains many fascinating and important essays on the history and current state of Latin@ spec fic, and introduced me to the ground-breaking work of Gloria Anzaldúa, who wrote about nepantla (the in-betweenness of worlds) and those beings: nepantleras who traverse that no-man’s land. Another author mentioned in the book was Reyes Cárdenas, a San Antonio poet and author of some short satirical science fiction poems called Los Pachucos y La Flying Saucer. For some reason this title appealed to me, and I strayed out of the proper feminista struggles represented in Altermundos into the sardonic poems of a macho, an eternal walker of el barrio, who spoke to me easily and in the very language of my own ill-spent youth in Albuquerque. You young punks will not remember when the pinto poets emerged upon the scene machine, a toda maquina, the knives, the bullets of the words they were shooting from the hip. Ricardo Sánchez, raulsalinas, whatever their crimes they turned into rhymes, Hechizospells from hell, the iron bars that held raul and his raza in the mind jail. When the pinto poets looked in the mirror, they didn’t see themselves — they saw all of us! Barefoot, stepping on goat heads, and riding bicycles for fifty miles in the relentless sun, there was probably a lot of my own experience that was shared with Reyes over in San Antonio; though to tell the truth I was a not only a double-outcast but a triple-outcast. I got shit not just from the Whites and the Mexicans. I got shit from the Gringos at Highland High, and the Chicanos from Martineztown, and Los Indios (who kicked me around for being a gringo). What saved me from being a quadruple-outcast, at Albuqueurque High, turned out to be the Mexican illegals who played on the soccer team. Those vatos were pretending to be teenagers with fake IDs, some of them in their mid-twenties, having crawled through barbed wire, swum through flash-flood arroyos, living on nothing but dreams and radioactive dust as they infiltrated the border and made their way to the South Valley. They were the only people as desperate and hungry as I was, and we knew by instinct that we were carnales. Nobody ever thought that a white kid could be so poor, as he sat under a tree reading piles of books. But that didn’t stop them, paradoxically, from spitting on him for wearing ragged clothes full of holes bought at Salvation Army, or kicking him out of school because his hair was long and tangled. In those days of the early 1970s, Albuquerque was still in the throes of the late 60s, and the reactionary forces were in full swing. Buzz cuts and gangs were the standard social reality, whereas long dreadlocks had never been seen, forget about on the head of gringo punk Jew from Chicago walking down the halls of Jefferson Junior High School! So yeah, when Reyes writes his stuff, it just flows with a normalcy that is uncanny in my brain. Even though I escaped the Land of Enchantment and rambled &#8212; with nada que perder &#8212; all over the globe, still those days get burned forever into one’s psyche and subconscious. Like Reyes says: It’s no longer nomás Yogi Berra’s déjà vu. You’ve become a stranger in your own land once again! And possibly that is one of the major simpaticos of la cienca ficción, when your back is against the wall and you are denied any place in a world of putas and pendejos who think they have some social status and ownership from which you are going to be evicted: yeah, there are pretty much only the realms of inner and outer space left to set up camp. with so few jobs back on Earth for a man of his color since the new edicts became the law of the land, space had become his only option. Well, the only thing I can say about this great book, Reyes Cardenas: Chicano Poet 1970-2010, is gracias primo for writing it! &nbsp;","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"poetry","slug":"poetry","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/poetry/"},{"name":"identity","slug":"identity","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/identity/"},{"name":"sabroso","slug":"sabroso","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/sabroso/"}]},{"title":"The mystique of Keleck","slug":"the-mystique-of-keleck","date":"2017-07-05T00:31:12.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-mystique-of-keleck/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-mystique-of-keleck/","excerpt":"My first taste of any artwork associated with Keleck (aka Kelek), was at Boskone this year, where Andy Gelas brought my attention to two French paperback editions of Conan.

But in Le Guerrier, the eyes, the skin, the deliberate brushstrokes on the wall, and the marble steps; they have a very different aesthetic from the super-slick air-brushing of Le Cimmerian. What is going on here? My first discovery is that Kelek, the artist, was the partner and collaborator of Jean-Michel Nicollet, and that they painted dozens (if not hundreds!) of illustrations together. Many of these are marvelous! The collaboration of Kelek (or Keleck) and Nicollet are attributed as cover artists for many (if not all!) of the titles in the paperback series: Titres SF, considered by many to be the best ever cover illustrations in France. The covers in this series are all imbued with classical references, as well as dadaist absurdity and intense hues from the Pop Art spectrum. Who were these amazing artists? From various sources, it is easy to track down Nicollet, who was born in Lyon in 1944. He studied art and developed a style of acrylic painting full of dark, strange, and supernatural images, which lent itself to the emerging crowd of Metal Hurlant in the late 1970s. However, on Nicollet’s French-language Wikipedia page, there is only one mention of Keleck, as his co-author on the books: Le Rejeton de l’univers (1980) and Ersatz (1981). This is strange, because many of the other references to Nicollet invariably refer to his “partnership” with Keleck. But who was Keleck? According to one brief biography, Keleck, was also from Lyon, born there in 1946. Her Wikipedia page characterizes Keleck illustrations as “peopled by pale beings who are extremely strange and glacial.” She is described as self-taught &#8212; an auto-didact &#8212; and several fannish reviews claim that she brought a 70’s punk defiance into her art. However, on deeper study, the first books published by Kelleck, were illustrations, I should say paintings, for Children’s stories. See for example her magnificent cover for Lubie ou pas Lubie (1975), which translates roughly as “A Whim or not a Whim,” although it was published in English under the title Crazy Days. This is hardly a 70s punk aesthetic! This is an hommage to the classics: to Henri Rousseau, of course, with the svelte jaguar in front of the foliage. But there is also something else going on in this painting, the animals are all in action. Whereas a Rousseau beast has an implication of energy, his canvases are always in a surreal moment of stasis, a half lucid state in between reality and dream. Keleck enters the same surrealistic realm with the perfect attention to detail, but in her cover painting for Crazy Days there is no restful complaisance; there is, instead, a mischievous rabbit hopping on the head of the beast, literally tweaking its nose and bolting away. The jaguar is roused, but not furious… more like annoyed by the capricious rascal that arrives and is gone in a flash. The background of this painting offers some more surrealistic detail: those fat tendrils of plants look almost like something from Fernand Leger, while the blob-like substances rising among them seem to be super-enlarged fish eggs &#8212; jungle caviar! The interior of the book is just as wonderful: take a close look at this odd masterpiece, where a jaguar-headed man is boxing with a bunny-headed woman! The man, in his jaguar skinned leotard, and the woman in her tight jaguar pants are posing, in this view, rather than actually boxing. But what a perfect opportunity for the bunny-woman to show off her giant black pearl necklace, her Coco buckled belt, and her arm length black silk gloves. There is an artifice to this painting, an unreality similar to a Rene Magritte painting, which is mixed up with an Adams family gothic fashion sense, and slowed down with an opium-pipe haze. If this book appeared in 1975, I would be willing to bet that Carlos Ochagavia saw it, and took off running with those glowing piles of egg-like orbs in his Agent Flandry covers (beginning some four years later). But let’s go back to Keleck and try to isolate her style from that of Nicollet. If we take a look at another early book she painted, Le Lion (1978), you’ve got to love the humor of the gazelle, showing us it’s ass! And the mother baboon, with one eye bizarrely rolled upwards. Why not the baboon’s ass, rather than the gazelle? Isn’t that how it is always done? Another tweak to the nose! Then there is the stunning cover! A magnificent lion is standing in the grass, while strange fan-like trees grow from a crystal blue lake. Overhead, in the twilight sky: bats! Five bats soaring in front of the moon and the stars. Marvelous! Janine Kotwica tells us that Kelek’s real name was Jacqueline Barse. Kotwica describes Kelek as follows: “practiced various artistic trades: display designer, graphic designer, modeler of the magazine Ah! Nana, interior designer, drawing and illustration teacher, set designer and costume designer for theater and contemporary dance, creates stage make-ups that she first experiences on her own, cultivating an unforgettable look Of Egyptian priestess.” Certainly that look was true, captured in the only photos that I could find of her so far. The photo above was taken by Robert Doisneau (the photographer famous for his photo Le baiser de l’hôtel de ville ). According to ArtNet, the photo was taken around 1970, and an original black and white print has a value of 1000 Euros. So that was Keleck? Posing in the frame between heavy curtains, her eyes are heavily blackened with kohl in the “Egyptian” style. Though if you ask me, these are much more like the eyes of a Richard Sala villain, than the traceries of an Eye of Horus. Her lips are heavily rouged, and her hair is tied up in a severe, flattened mass, with an almost feline angle on either side, like the laid back ears of a giant cat ready to pounce. Notice the intense backlight framing her head and shoulders, throwing the left side of her face into shadow, while a fill light on the right reveals her incredibly pale face, no doubt powdered to a ghostly white! Is that a real or artificial mole at the apex of the cheekbone? The foreground light also reveals Kelek’s tapering delicate fingers, most of them wearing chunky, oddly ornate rings. She is lightly tweaking a cigaret holder in her right hand, as if raising it to take a puff, and her raised hand shows the white starched cuff of her shirt sleeve, which is fastened at the neck with a man’s Carnaby Street striped tie. It’s also a men’s single-breasted jacket she is wearing, with a flower &#8212; is that an orchid! &#8212; in the boutonnierre. The only thing I can conclude from this photo is that it is a perfectly staged performance. The whole photo is half shadow, half light. The combination of backlight and silhouette turns one side of Kelek’s face into a shadow, and the other washes out into a tangle of frizzy hair: almost exactly like the face in Le Guerrier. It is hard to fathom the cross-dressing: is it an androgynous image, or a projection of a challenge to male expectations, riffing on Marlene Dietrich, perhaps? This is a bizarre masterpiece of moodiness, and as a portrait, we can only marvel at the woman who presented herself in such a stylized, neo-gothic chiascuro. It’s fairly obvious where the model for the cover of the book Ersatz came from. Published in 1981, the book reprints in full color some of the Titres SF cover illustrations, along with other paintings (from Metal Hurlant) that reveal more of a morbid and sado-masochistic sexuality. Clearly this was a mutual fascination for Nicollet and Keleck, as can be seen in their collaborative works, as well as Keleck’s contributions (as a founding contributor) to the magazine Ah! Nana, which has been called an early feminist journal. Produced by women and featuring woman-authored bandes dessinées comics, the first issue described the origin of the magazine: “Several female artists, colourists and journalists were complaining to each other about having to incorporate male fantasies disguised as essential features of publishing into our work. We decided to act, sketching out the idea of a journal…” Despite the challenge issues to male fantasies, the topics of magazine covered Cruelty, S&amp;M, Sex and Little Girls, Trans-sexuality, and Incest. Keleck’s cover for the premier issue of Ah! Nana is not particularly interesting &#8212; showing a man strip dancing in front of raucously amused blue-skinned women &#8212; but the design and details of the painting are nonetheless characteristically Kelleck. The heavy drapes framing the image, the intense backlight, the cigaret holder, the slightly unfinished faces. It is in the Ah! Nana cover that we can begin to pick out the “Keleck-style” when it is the major factor of the collaborative Titres SF covers. Compare, for example the faces of the blue-skinned women to Ratinox se Venge. Not only is the skin tone blue-gray, but the features are slightly flattened and stylized. The face of Angelina looks like a self-portrait of Keleck. We might also speculate that self-portrait themes run through the collaborators ouevre. In Le Rejeton de l’univers (1980), the cover is clearly taken from the infamous photo of Aleister Crowley, but the nose is clearly that of Nicollet himself. &nbsp; Might we not also surmise that the gypsy woman from the same book is modeled on Keleck? (c) Getty Images Indeed the cover of Ersatz (1981), (linked above) is pure self-portraiture. In this case they portray themselves as creepy cold-blooded predators: are they drinking blood from a tube protruding from the skull of a prone, blue-eyed (possibly alien) victim? Who knows… Another insight into Keleck’s art can be found in her 1984 surrealistic postcard series, a morbid gray and red series of absolute strangeness, bordering on terror. The strange realm of Keleck’s paintings reach their finest polish in the series of children’s books that she illustrated for Editions Hatier (in the late 1980s), including Les Contes de Perrault, Le Magicien D’Oz, Les Frers Grimm. These paintings deserve their own long treatise, indeed a comparison with Gustave Dore can already be found; but let us just marvel at them for now… from the Brothers Grimm from Wizard of Oz &nbsp; from Contes de Perrault from Bros Grimm Unfortunately Keleck died in 2003 (age 57), so we cannot ask her more. Her partner, Nicollet, went on to illustrate many more books, among them a bizarre visit to the Bardo during the day of Keleck’s death, called Apparitions. Perhaps the life of Keleck will &#8212; and must &#8212; remain an unfathomable mystery. After all, her life partner’s tribute to her memory is a strange grotesquerie about the transmigration of her soul. Some trails &#8212; some Fates &#8212; disappear into swirls of smoke, that we need not follow. Expo Kelek - Ardentes - Invitation card (1985) Les Androïdes rêvent-ils de moutons électriques?

Griffin You would think that a novel investigating the inner life of a freak &#8212; indeed, the freak of freaks: Elephant Man &#8212; would be grim, depressing, and bleak. You would think that the transformation of one’s body into something hideous and grotesque as a terrible ordeal. Moreover the psychological pressure of being an actual monster in physical form should be a topic almost unbearable to explore. And yet, in this novel, The Blind Men and the Elephant, Russell M. Griffin explores all of these difficult ideas and emotions, he pokes them with needles and rubs salt on them over and over again… but strangely enough, he achieves an ethereal, almost philosophical understanding of the subject in the end, and instead of weeping with saccharine sympathy the reader is left pondering moral issues, and laughing bitterly at human weakness. It helps that the book is framed as a social commentary and a bitter satire on the hopeless losers of the small town, Butler, Massachusetts. The protagonist Durwood Leffingwell is a washed up weatherman at a low budget local t.v. station, who smokes dope with the cameraman, and watches with seeming disinterest as his marriage deteriorates. The cheapness and selfishness of the cast of characters is obvious from the opening lines, evoked with deft jabs and devastating clarity. The raw comedy of this book is demonstrated in the first glimpse of Leffingwell’s job, when he is rousted out of bed to answer a phone call from his boss, Trammel, down at the t.v. station: “I’m trying to cope. Cope with a little prob we’ve got down on this end.” Leffingwell took a deep breath and let go of his day off. “Shoot.” “It’s about our live coverage of the parade today.” “Just about to tune in and watch,” Leffingwell lied. “You know it’s the biggest thing we’ve done. We’ve got thousands tied up in telephone line rental and the remote van and the pro switchers from Boston… I mean, Leffingwell, this is a live remote! This is the big time! This is like ABC doing the Olympics!” Trammel paused, letting the grandeur of it sink in. “That’s why I was just sick when I got the call from St. Joe’s just now.” “The hospital? Oberon didn’t slash her wrists again, did she? “No, it’s Tanker Hackett. He’s in traction.” “Traction?” “They totaled Curt’s VW Rabbit.” “Curt too? Is he all right?” “Yeah, but his Private Cusp suit’s just a lot of fiberglass tooth crumbs all over Route 111-A. Leffingwell, Sergeant Smile and Private Cusp were supposed to attract kiddie viewers. We’ve got no moppet interest. WE’RE ABOUT TO SEE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GO DOWN THE TUBE!” Leffingwell was silent, suspecting where Trammel was headed. Ever since Leffingwell’s promotion to weatherman on the Ten O’Clock News, he’d been supplementing his $97.50 a week take-home by helping out on Sergeant Smile and the Tooth Brigade as the mute end of the many-toothed Mr. Laffy the Horse. And it all just gets worse from there. Each line, which seems like a throw-away gag, actually gets tied into the plot during the course of the book. Griffin manages to escoriate the whole of American society, revealing it’s raw World Weekly News-fed underbelly. In the course of the book, Leffingwell gets involved with the Elephant Man, picking up from the freak show pimp who dumped him unceremoniously in Butler, Mass, and plays out his own greed and cynicism against a back-drop of grasping locals, corrupt judges, self-promoting minor poets, and the various phony personalities of the t.v. station. There are deep moments of self-reflection from the Elephant Man, who is utterly disconnected with human society, and who painfully reconstructs his past, trying to understand his origins and the meaning for his life on earth. The facetious musings of a theologian, and the intrusion of mysterious pursuers wearing sunglasses, point to a horrible truth which is revealed to all eventually. What makes this novel significant, and not just a slap-stick comedy, is the way in which each of the characters hides and attempts to reconstruct their understanding of what the Elephant Man really is. For the theologian, the Virgin birth (which is simultaneously a miracle and an abomination) is too much for his mind to handle and he snaps. For Leffingwell, the truth becomes a moral question of whether he will continue to hurt and exploit someone who has done him no harm. And for Mother Superior, what good does it do to finally know with certainty that the one child who needed her the most was the one she abandoned? As she wanders through the wreckage of her life’s work, who was saved? Was anyone really even helped? As for the Elephant Man himself, the truth and catharsis it brings is just another punishment, like Antoine Doinel in The 400 Blows he is left walking in the surf and turning around to face the emptiness of a Universe without meaning or mercy. In the Elephant Man’s case, he is not on the beach, but in a parking lot after having been acquitted of a false charge in court. But his regained freedom is too little and too late to save him from the reality of his own Being. Even Leffingwell, who discovers his own compassion too late in the game, only succeeds in raising his protest to the level of being a nuisance to the powers that be. With his memory erased, and all the knowing parties either dead, missing, or gone mad, there is no epitaph for the Elephant Man’s true nature. You’d think all of this is terribly sad, but strangely enough you will spend more time roaring with laughter at this book, then you will stifling back tears. One drawback, which I should mention, is that the women in the book are generally grasping, selfish, and confused, and seem to randomly focus their affections on men in the story with a sense of pointlessness and low self esteem. You could fault Griffin on this, and say it is somewhat sexist. On the other hand, if you look at the whole story, in my view, the male characters are equally self-centered, empty, and blinded by egotism. I think it is an equal opportunity castigation of American society. There are moments in the plot where humanity shines through, which is why I would recommend it. When Leffingwell has mindlessly set up a porno film production involving the Elephant Man as a million dollar idea it is perfectly reflected by the cameraman Stackpole who realizes with disgust what is going on. “Leff, my man,” said Stackpole, “I just cut myself out.” He handed Leffingwell the massive camera. “You do anything you want to from here on, but you do it without me.” “But why, Stackpole?” Leffingwell said feverishly. “Why? It’s inhuman,” Stackpole said. “The road back to the human race is through this door.” Leffingwell was suddenly alone, the heavy camera tugging at his arm. His face burned. He hated himself. And in these moments of realization, in the midst of wicked satire, this book proves itself worthy of the title.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"social mores","slug":"social-mores","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/social-mores/"},{"name":"book review","slug":"book-review","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/book-review/"},{"name":"horror","slug":"horror","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/horror/"},{"name":"satire","slug":"satire","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/satire/"},{"name":"speculative fiction","slug":"speculative-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/speculative-fiction/"},{"name":"television","slug":"television","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/television/"}]},{"title":"Rankled into Action, 2017","slug":"rankled-into-action-2017","date":"2017-01-03T02:21:39.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"COSMOS/rankled-into-action-2017/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/COSMOS/rankled-into-action-2017/","excerpt":"","text":"Happy New Year to all living beings!

Our Treaties and our human rights were ignored, our interests in protecting lands and waters were considered unimportant, and our voices were not heard. It was this shared history that led Tribes to come together as never before to seek the protection of our waters against the threat of the Dakota Access pipeline. With peace and prayer, indigenous people from hundreds of Tribes said: our future is too important. We can no longer be ignored. The goal was to protect these sacred waters, and to do so in the name of our children. And, with yesterday’s decision, it is clear that our voices have at long last been heard. Yesterday’s decision demonstrates that, despite all the challenges that Tribes face and all of the terrible wrongs the federal government has committed in dealing with us over the years, justice for Indian people still remains possible. My thanks to the Obama Administration, and particularly to Assistant Secretary Darcy, for upholding the law and doing the right thing. Yesterday’s decision belongs in large measure to the thousands of courageous people who put their lives on hold to stand with Standing Rock in support of a basic principle &#8212; that water is life. At Standing Rock, our youth played an important role in spreading our message and I am so proud of what they have been able to accomplish. But Standing Rock could not have come this far alone. Hundreds of tribes came together in a display of tribal unity not seen in hundreds of years. And many thousands of indigenous people from around the world have prayed with us and made us stronger. I am grateful to each of you. And, as we turn a page with yesterday’s decision, I look forward to working with many of you as you return to your home communities to protect your lands and waters, and the sovereignty of your tribes. My thanks to all of our allies, here and around the world, each of whom contributed to this effort. I want to give a special mention to the veterans who have come to Standing Rock in recent days. I am sure that the strength of your message in support of Standing Rock, and the rights of the Water Protectors, had a powerful impact as the Army made its decision. I appreciate all you have done. While today is a great day, there is still much that needs to be done to protect Tribal rights and ensure justice for indigenous people everywhere. Using peace and prayer as our guideposts, and with the teachings of our elders and with inspiration from our youth, I believe there is much we can accomplish for the future.

Is it something in the soil? Something in the dusty valleys scorched by the desert sun where even lizards fear to crawl and only the toughest, gnarliest lifeforms can eke out an existence, raving into the blue-black sky with a fierce scream of defiance: Universe, que haces, Universe! Sure, there is a lightness of being under the enchanted sky, and a fatalistic attitude of total abandon, defiance, and belligerence that makes New Mexico what it is. That spirit thrives in those green chilis. They are like the super-energy pills eaten by Underdog, no kidding. Now most people on the East coast can get their chilis in a jar, or a can, or flash-frozen and flown to them by next day Fedex… but normal home-grown New Mexicans are a sort of funky gang. We just want a paper bag of chilis with the stems on so that we can roast and peel ‘em at home. We even watch the local news (KOAT-TV) to see what is going on in the big city &#8212; Albuquerque &#8212; and it’s daily batch of grisly murders, head-on car wrecks, drug-crazed robberies, car chases, shoot-outs, and the occasional “human-interest” story: you know, like a retired firefighter giving some pre-schoolers karate lessons, or some shit like that. Thus, it should come as no surprise to you, dear reader, that I already KNEW the green chili season was early this year! There was a report in July that chilis were almost ready to harvest, so I had my eyes peeled! Sure enough Sophia and I spotted a few bins of the gorgeous Hatch green chilis last weekend at Whole Foods. We snapped up about half of them, which turned out to be eight pounds. Eight gorgeous pounds of fresh green chilis straight off the truck from Nuevo Mexico. What could be better? We washed them and started lining them up on roasting pans: fresh chilis ready to roast After charring the skins in the broiler, we tossed them to cool in a bowl. nicely charred Then we start lining them up on a cutting board, just to look at em all before wrapping them. Once they are cooled off, we double wrap piles of six chilis in plastic wrap bundles. They can be frozen, and after thawing and peeling off the skins, cooked up in meal sized batches any time! The first batch was so chewy and fresh! I had about 1/6 of the batch left over and was able to make a New Mexico style wet burrito after getting one to take out from La Victoria taqueria.

A con was where your propellor beanie, flowing cape, Vulcan ears, and purple velvet bag-of-holding concealing a pint of scumble were perfectly normal, and you were surrounded by fellow fen celebrating the freedom to be weird. Not that this spirit of letting our freak flag fly has changed all that much, but what has changed is the sense that certain values, certain codes of conduct, and the moral obligation to represent people of color, women, Moslems, GLBT, or any group that has been under-represented until now is no longer an option. It is this feeling of political correctness acting as a form of coercion that has become a lightning rod in recent years. Personally, I can commiserate with anyone who feels oppressed and alienated in this crazy consumerist society we live in. I think tearing down the patriarchy is a good thing: and I would like to tear down Wall Street, the military intelligence complex, industrialized farming, and big Pharma while we are at it! The more panels we have on Afro-futurism, women writers, alternate cultures, and tree frogs the better! (Disclosure: I also like tree frogs.) What I hope we can avoid is to shed the old normalized social forms of oligarchy and privelege and exchange them for a new vanguard of behavioural gate-keepers who are going to dictate to us what is the new norm. That could be dangerous. The impression that this has already taken place is the raison d’être of the so-called Rabid Puppies. They seem to think that a secret cabal of SJWs is pulling the strings of fandom, loading the Hugo slates with works by women and minorities, in a way that is unfair and disenfranchises them, whoever they are. This theory is, to say the least: totally fucking crazy. Just to promote the books you think are deserving of recognition does not enlist you into a secret cabal. By contrast, to promote a particular slate of works and recruit as many people as possible to vote for exactly the same slate is to form a public cabal. If the intention is to disrupt the nomination process of the Hugo awards, then this is a form of conspiracy. It is a group of people deliberately conspiring to bombard a public process with monkey-wrenches. Yes, there are some wild monkeys who throw shit at everyone and scream. People who emulate this behaviour should not be the ones to decide how others behave. Did these people not get the memo? Consequently, the recriminations and accusations that resulted from this whole debacle tends to make con-runners and SMOFs more defensive and more rule-oriented than they were in the past. Of necessity cons must remain open and inclusionary. Every type of fan should be welcome and feel safe among their fellow fen. On the other hand, this requires some rules and boundaries to be set. We can no longer assume that unwritten codes of common decency are effective, and therefore things have to be written down. And this, of course, just seems to reinforce the paranoid notion that there are some SJWs hiding out on secret committees to enforce their concept of appropriateness. What a mess. From my humble rock on the bottom of the pond it seems like the crazies have poisoned the well. They came screaming out their echo chamber to sabotage the commons. I feel like I am in one of David Bunch’s Moderan stories. The uber-paranoid attack dogs have gotten off their leash. Who the hell knows what will happen next. But this is not what actually happened at Readercon 2016. What actually happened is that the con moved from the bucolic green sward of Burlington to the (pardon my French) ass-end of Quincy. Many people were happy with the new hotel and location. I thought it was a miserable nightmare, perched on an outcrop of rock and cement overlooking bleak highways, and at the very end of a long, steep, searingly ugly driveway untrodden by human beings. William Hope Hodgson might have liked this spot, as a model for the gateway to a dimension of terror. But I didn’t find very nice. Okay, I am being bitchy. Maybe for people who only drive in those apocalypse-inducing internal combustion bombs the Quincy Marriott is fine. But for me, riding public transit, it was hell. Two solid hours it took for me to get from Alewife to Quincy Adams. A full month has passed, and I am still a bit queasy from the mess that the T made of my trips to Readercon this year. Okay, it is not entirely Readercon’s fault. The repair work that forced a bus connection from Kendall to Park is not supposed to be permanent: but it should have been predictable! And the same goes for the fact that trains simply DO NOT run beyond JFK on the weekends. Typical waiting times at JFK are 20 minutes, so if you are switching from an Ashmont train to a Braintree train you are just shit out of luck. This is all something that Readercon must have known. Gripe-fest concluded, the con itself was pretty damn fun, as usual. Except for the grief that we all felt for losing David Hartwell &#8212; his framed photo and tie standing in mute tribute in the Dealer Room &#8212; everyone I met was in a fine mood. From the New Paltz writer who had gafiated for two decades, to the regulars like George Morgan, Mark Borok, Diane Weinstein, Ed Koenig, Frank Wu, Neil Clarke and so on… it was an amazingly fun time. One faanish highlight were a my conversations with Jean Berman, who was John H. Costello’s partner for many years. Last year, she was largely responsible for making his entire book collection available for free, and several boxes remaining from that huge stash were still visible on this year’s freebie tables. I bought my usual stack of goodies in the Dealer Room, and had a terrific time talking to Neil Clarke, Jean Gonzalez, and various people wandering around the tables. On Friday, July 8th, there were a preponderance of panels on Dystopia and Apocalypse… do we wonder why? In the mundane real world we have an actual proto-fascist running as the nominee for POTUS. Let us retreat into our world of “cozy dystopias” and hide! But of course, the coziness is not all fun and games. Looking at Harry Potter’s school, Hogwarts, as an example, the panelists of Cozy Dystopias were quick to point out that extra-judicial killings and soul-suckings that take place at the talons of evil Dementors are not exactly cozy. The Ministry of Magic also functions as an oppressive government &#8212; with no transparency &#8212; and is utterly restricted and elitist. Many of the main characters and their family members, though they benefit from their appointments or relationships with the Ministry, are also subject to it’s capricious decisions, and often have no idea what is going on. Indeed, it was only the mud-blood, Hermione, as an outsider to the elitist system of social mobility, who establishes the House of Rights. Being outside, Hermione can bear witness the injustices that are otherwise ignored. And why is it Hermione, not Harry, who becomes an activist? She’s smarter than him, for one thing. In a session called Author Trademark or Personal Cliché the panelists explored the writing of various authors, looking for particularities that represent their individual styles. Are these traits in an author’s work intentional or subconscious? Gillian Daniels said that “Writing is like presenting a view of yourself in the mirror that you don’t want to show anyone; but you do anyway!” How to get inside the head of a writer and know what they were thinking? Trying to grasp another writer’s obsession: that would be an interesting challenge, the panelists agreed. I missed the panel Integrating the Id, which apparently explored all manner of sexuality. But a choice quote from Chip Delany made it to the twitter-verse: “Be ready for someone to tell you: &#8216;I am sorry. The last time I had sex with a camel, it was nothing like that.’ “ On Saturday morning, there was a lack-luster panel called Sorting Taxonomies, which had great panelists &#8212; including Peter Straub and Greer Gilman &#8212; but was often constrained by the narrow questions from the moderator, Nepveau. She wanted the panelists to rattle off a bullet list of characteristics that define genre, but the panelists contrarily went off on their own tangents, speculating on what constitutes the voice and vision of certain authors. Gilman said that it is not so much a set of traits that attracts her to a certain type of writing, but rather the “details of what the author is filtering out of the Universe for me to notice: a drowned arm… with bracelets! Walking out to look for the evening star… then the Evening Star comes to life and becomes a character!” It was nonetheless interesting to watch Straub, snapping his neck around suddenly, to peer at someone with awesome intensity; or to watch Gilman, as she stares up to the sky while speaking in general (usually poetic) terms, then looks down at others when making a point. Overheard in the con-suite, first fandom’s David Kyle was talking about an astronaut returning to Earth who picks up radio signals that were originally broadcast decades earlier from stations and transmitters that no longer exist. “It’s quite possible,” Kyle speculated, “that certain kinds of radiation or vibrations exist that can last forever. They might go on echoing through the Universe for all eternity.” While attending the Sorting Taxonomies panel, I managed to miss Beyond Strong Female Characters, which seems to have generated the most controversy this year. In a session described as a shit-show, the moderator managed to insult the only African American woman on the panel, Mikki Kendall. Kendall’s reaction seemed measured, while others responded with more anger at the situation. This reached a boiling point with a blogger who expresses volcanic eruptions of anger with hair-trigger sensitivity. Sure, it is fine to be angry, and never to back down on issues of racism, sexism, bigotry, and injustice. I am 100% down with that, and support the need for action. But, call me whatever you want, (I’m not trying to be the tone-police, here), I just find it counter-productive to constantly be attacking and insulting everyone who you don’t approve of. Somebody with the track record of Vox needs to be cut down to size, but I don’t really perceive Ellen Kushner as the enemy. Sounds like she was being snobby and bitchy. There has got to be a better way to carry this conversation forward and improve our society. In truth, I think Mikki Kendall and Ellen Kushner working this out in public is the best thing that can happen, and I hope it leads to more interesting and better integrated, more open and less hostile discussions all over the place. Another bit of flak erupted in the Blue Collar SF panel, which surprised me mostly by managing NOT to mention labor history, socialism, the Wobblies, or anything else very political. Bud Sparhawk spent a lot of time talking about his own stories that featured working class characters, including one case where the machinists working on some sort of space-tech had to take matters into their own hands because the designs provided to them by a huge team of designers and engineers had flaws when it came time to actually assemble the stuff. The moderator, Allen Steele remarked: “too many chiefs, not enough injuns.” This comment was careless, in poor taste, even insulting to Native Americans. No doubt about that. According to one reviewer, the statement caused several in the audience to get up and leave, but she stayed on because it’s hard to look away from an accident,” and she hope that “clueless leaders will experience a corrective from their co-panelists.” But on the other hand, I was there, and I specifically heard Sparhawk’s story that prompted the comment. It was a poor choice of words, yeah; but later I saw a posts on twitter questioning why Steele was even on the panel in the first place and insinuating that he was a racist. Well, it’s pretty clear that Steele writes near-future SF about working class characters… that was why he was on the Blue Collar SF panel. And he did write a novel with a Native American protagonist, Clarke County Space. Though some people have dumped on his “Colonialist” Coyote series, I think Steele has done a fairly decent job of writing about people from different races and backgrounds in his books. Do I wish there were more Native American SF writers, and more SF books featuring Native Americans? Hell yes! I’m a big fan of G. C. Edmondson’s Chapayeca (aka Blue Face), for one example. As for Steele’s character, Detective John Bighorn, he is not perfect, but he doesn’t come across as a cliché, or seem quite the noble savage template of Andre Norton’s Beastmaster. My reading of Steele gives me the impression that his intentions are good, whereas I’m not sure if I would cut the same slack to the cultural appropriation in J. K. Rowling’s Native American wizard “history”. In sum, I just think that we can be prickly, we can call each other out, but we can also smoke a peace pipe and build a better society to live in! Let’s get on to that constructive part, because the real racists, bigots, and right-wing reactionaries would absolutely LOVE to see us divided and squabbling forever… If we go on that way, Vox and his friends will be cackling like vultures on their Saguaro cacti. We’re science fiction faans. We started all this shit: fandom, zines, cons, sub-cultures, ultra-networked self-reflective agents of social change. We can do this. This is our community mission, and we are shit out of time, with no room for failure. We’ve got this. On a lighter note, it was terrific to attend the GOH Interview with Tim Powers, conducted by Gary K. Wolfe. Though I am a huge Powers fan, my main reason for this is his novel Anubis Gates. There were a few other books of his that I couldn’t quite get through. But after hearing this lively interview, I’ve definitely rekindled my interest. For instance, Powers said “when it comes to ouija boards, tarot, and the like, I think it’s all nonsense. I don’t believe ANY of it. But, I’m scared of it!” And “writing within the bounds of actual historical events is like working within the lines of a tennis court to play a match. What I do, is not to reconstruct the entire historical narrative… I just look for cool things to pluck out, and then I string them together.” Ah, that explains it! “You approach the research of historical facts with an honorary paranoid-schizophrenic squint: did you know that Edison’s last breath was caught in a test tube with a cork! Really, it’s in Dearborn, Michigan, in the Edison museum. So when History just gives you details like this &#8212; and it ALWAYS DOES &#8212; you just go with them.” “To draw the reader into the supernatural story, you seed in references to the real world… That sonnet. Those cave paintings. Did you know that the body of the poet Shelley, having been drowned, was found with his face and hands eaten by fish. Yeah, RIGHT! By fish! This stuff just writes itself.” Since we all have that primordial part of the brain that lights up in terror, I say: let’s light that up!” Inspired by Powers anecdotes, I then bought copies of Declare and John Berlyne’s Tim Powers Secret Histories which is just a mammoth Bibliography of Powers’ works. The Berlyne book also has an essay on Anubis Gates by China Mieville, which is worth the price of admission. “Anubis Gates is a carnavelesque of amazing generosity. It revels in its magicians, its historical conspiracies, its beggar-princes, its identityless brawling poets, its philosophizing monsters, its eggshell-sailors, its cross-dressing investigators, its quasi-werewolf body-jumping serial killers. Among other things.” Indeed!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"},{"name":"controversy","slug":"controversy","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/controversy/"}]},{"title":"Redemption Song","slug":"redemption-song","date":"2016-07-21T07:40:57.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/redemption-song/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/redemption-song/","excerpt":"","text":"Andreis Peregudovs being led to find the stolen stash of money. Pondering the depths of guilt and despair, the criminal is led to the scene of a crime. His handlers are not brutal, they too are subdued; as if ashamed themselves, and feeling the general shame of a greedy act. Well, it was a robbery &#8212; which is wrong &#8212; but it was not murder or assault or physically violent. It was an intellectual job, a computerized heist, involving hackers and exploits that emptied the contents of ATM machines into the hands of a well-organized gang. The thieves, apparently, had been active for some time. Wreaking their computerized havoc on the banks of Europe and America almost with impunity, they suddenly fell into a trap on the yam-shaped island. And now, one of the ring-leaders, being led in handcuffs and muddy slippers down the rain-streaked hillside, bows his head. He looks penitent. He had asked his captors if there was a possibility of the death penalty. His white plastic rain poncho is framed by the dripping yellow ponchos of the unarmed policemen, as they try not to slip on the steep muddy path. Somewhere along the trail, a filthy old duffel bag, bursting with stacks of 100 NT$ bills, awaited them. This scene, at once so droll and unrehearsed, captured in the midst of the investigation process, has a strangely beautiful, glowing, transcendence to it. For some reason, when I saw the form of the suspect, hands bound, his long sinewy body twisting slightly and lost in deep meditation on his own sins, I suddenly thought of the paintings of El Greco. Those giant lush canvases, full of figures interacting in various angular poses, which decompose into brightly contrasting zones of color, are imbued with El Greco’s heavy Catholocism, and scenes of melancholy; like The Disrobing of Christ. The Disrobing of Christ, El Greco (1579) What an odd thought, really. It is not that I sympathize with the criminal so much as respect the care and sense of calm which the police have in dealing with the matter. All of this captured in the lens and splashed in a vertical composition of slow and moody actions built out of rich flat color shapes. This is a great photo. If nothing else, it brings me to the rainy and muddy steps in the forest where the bag of money was dumped. It puts me exactly into the scene, and into the mood. How will it end?

This is directly across the street from entrance to the Harvard Art Museum, at the gate between Philosophy, Robinson and Sever Halls. It is a fairly good traffic spot in the mornings. Whoever posted this has my kudos! It’s actually a pretty funny mash-up of the “Hide ya kids, hide yo wife” meme with the idiotic fear-mongering that has been going on about Bernie Sanders and the menace of “democratic socialism.” Making use of an old-fashioned image of the iconic Russian bear attacking and slavering on top of prone Uncle Sam is rather ridiculous… Bernie’s political life and positions have nothing to do with Russia or with Russia’s state planned socialism. Indeed, if Americans had any sense of reality whatsoever, they would realize that entire purpose of our Federal government and its institutions is socialist in nature. Assuming democracy actually exists here in the USA &#8212; which is seriously in doubt after the recent debacle in Las Vegas has revealed &#8212; then it is most certainly democratic socialism to begin with. Really, we could only be so lucky as to adopt the policies discussed by Michael Moore in Where to Invade Next, and be slightly more in tune with the times in order to enjoy the advantages that democratic social policies provide. Of course, the “Wants You” slogan predicates the idea that this strange and monstrous thing &#8212; this democratic socialism thing &#8212; is simultaneously going to destroy your peace and security (thus Hide Ya Kids, Hide Ya Wife), and at the same time recruit you to join it. How insidious! The thing you fear will propagandize you into joining it. Pretty amusing! This is clearly a fun bit of agit-prop, deliberately messing with our “normal” brainwashing program, that is beamed at us 24 hours a day. Thanks for that chuckle, hermano!

Donnell","slug":"the-sleek-and-memorable-art-of-a-j-donnell","date":"2016-05-14T21:52:05.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-sleek-and-memorable-art-of-a-j-donnell/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-sleek-and-memorable-art-of-a-j-donnell/","excerpt":"","text":"In another post (about blood moons and werewolves) I had occasion to examine the various cover paintings for Jack Williamson’s great novel, Darker Than You Think. In addition to Edd Cartier’s black and white illustration, Jeff Jones’ transmogrification of tigers and snakes, and David G. Klein’s rather literalist take on the eros and violence in the book, I was strangely charmed by the cover painting done by A. J. Donnell. Who was A. J. Donnell, I wondered? It turns out that I couldn’t dig up much info on him. Andrew Julian Donnell seems to have served as a Staff Sergeant in WWII, according to the gravestone in Fort Scott, Bourbon County, Kansas, which gives his dates as 1905 to 1991. The ISFDB indicates that he was born in Kansas City, about 90 miles north of where he was buried. After his stint in WWII, A. J. Donnell was living in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he was an artist working for the Glidden Paint Company. According to Lloyd Arthur Esbach’s account of how he founded the Fantasy Press, Donnell was one of the first four investors, who teamed up to put in $500 each in order to launch the company. As Esbach tells it, he was kicking the idea around with his co-worker, G. H. MacGregor, who said: “We could get Donnell here”—the artist who was in the room at the time—“and he could do the illustrating. Maybe add Leman Houck—he’s a bookkeeper—and with each of us putting in five hundred we’d be on our way.” (see “The Fantasy Press Story” published in Earl Kemp’s eI27, Aug 2006) But hardly anything else is known about the artist. The Science Fiction Encyclopedia provides a thoughtful reflection on his art. Donnell’s covers tended to emphasize simply drawn designs, but these often seemed perfectly appropriate for the material; his stark, sometimes monochromatic renderings of spacecraft for the covers for Smith’s Space Operas, for example, capture the unpolished energy of this work much better than later, more sophisticated artwork. Also, although Robert Weinberg reports that Donnell had little attachment to sf, he apparently read the books he illustrated with unusual care, as indicated by his cover for Heinlein’s _Beyond This Horizon, since its image of a boy playing with sand inside an hourglass perfectly captures the novel’s central theme: a long effort to craft a superior human being through generations of careful breeding. Similarly, his arresting cover for Stanley G Weinbaum’s A Martian Odyssey and Others_, showing a masked Egyptian bowing toward a birdlike Martian, cleverly illustrates Donnell’s awareness of the theory expressed in Weinbaum’s “Valley of Dreams”, that Martians like his Tweel had visited ancient Egypt to be received as gods. (see SFE A. J. Donnell) Robert Weinberg, in his Biographical Dictionary comments that Donnell was the staff artist for The Whilhelm Ambassador, whatever that was. I found a 1939 copyright entry for a periodical called “Wilhelm ambassador,” so I suppose that was it. But, apparently whatever Donnell created for that publication is long forgotten. Not the case for his science fiction art, which is sleek, polished, and memorable. If the cover for Stanley Weinbaum’s The Black Flame doesn’t knock your socks off, then I can’t help you! Since Donnell was both the art director and illustrator for the early Fantasy Press covers, he was designing the covers, lettering them, and probably setting up the color separations as well. His simple and yet effective use of the cover designs &#8212; in this case with red letters floating over a woman’s towering (and sparkling!) coiffure &#8212; is typically something that would have artist and art director strangling each other over an office desk. But here, on the soft green background, it just works! You can see where he was going with the original illustration, contrasting the soft gradient of the skin tones that had a hint of warmth, against the vivid strokes of black india ink swirling through the woman’s hair. Adding the sparkling white stars to soften the crisp lines, also showed off Donnell’s technical skill as an illustrator. The ravages of war in space are neatly depicted in Donnell’s painting for Triplanetary, first book in Doc Smith’s Lensman series. Here the use of airbrush, oil, and hand-painted lettering is simply fantastic. The smooth cylinders of the spaceships are tumbling through the sky like so many compressed air tanks, some of them bursting into flames or burnt into useless chunks of smoldering metal. This band of destruction is emanating from a mandala-like shape hanging in the sky &#8212; apparently the Nevians spaceship unleashing their death ray that melts all it touches into an allotropic iron plasma. There is an exceptional subtlety in the way Donnell has used a simple, blurry geometric shape to represent the superior alien race. Once again, the boldness with which Donnell framed the colorless death ray against a bright blue sky, and the way he slashed across the action with a boldly outlined red title demonstrates what an artist is willing to do when focused on the the impact of the complete design, rather than just the painting. Another curiosity, is Donnell’s unused cover design for First Lensman. In this cover, the lens &#8212; a device that super-amplifies the mental powers of the wearer &#8212; looks like a fancy wristwatch, with a luxurious band. The anonymous face, floating in space behind the lens, and the trickles of stars floating around it look more like bubbles in water than stars. Clearly this design was not going to make for a stunning cover. The lettering was pretty neat, though! It’s worth noting the cover that Donnell painted for Sinister Barrier. As mentioned in the SFE article, Donnell was clearly reading the books that he illustrated, for here we see the evil Vril as floating orbs hovering over and impinging upon a tortured, helpless human figure. This image is taken directly from the story, and is rather effective as a design, though not a very strong as an illustration. On a similar note, the cover for Book of Ptath, is a great design with uneven work in the illustration itself. Almost characteristic to Donnell’s style, there are elements rendered in tight delineation, such as the ornamental sceptre, while surrounding it is a vague blurry ray, in this case spiraling upward as an ethereal beam of light. The occult symbology here, like that of a tarot card, is perfect for the subject matter, the arcane Book of Ptath, which is hastily tossed in as a “book” shape in the corner. Though the illustration is not particularly strong, the occult theme is effective, while the strong red and black shapes hit you like a punch in the nose. Finally, I would like to mention Donnell’s interpretation of The Legion of Space, which is nothing more than a sleek looking tower, rising in cold and windowless arrogance into a hot pink sky. It has a clean, art deco streamlined look. The font on the huge black band (which does not seem hand-written) that takes up nearly a third of the cover area, is crisp and perfect, as is the longhand script for the author’s name floating at the top. The simplicity and power of this book jacket design should have Chip Kidd slapping his forehead in awe and admiration. It is just sleek, pristine, arresting. Few covers from small presses in the 1950s could touch those of A. J. Donnell, and it is worth giving them another look.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"biography","slug":"biography","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/biography/"},{"name":"design","slug":"design","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/design/"}]},{"title":"Island Under the Earth","slug":"island-under-the-earth","date":"2016-05-08T19:09:40.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/island-under-the-earth/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/island-under-the-earth/","excerpt":"","text":"That inertia is the tendency of a body, when cold, to stay cold; and when hot, to stay hot &#8212; that during Star-flux when the thin white lines which cross and crisscross the skies of night tremble and waver and bend and then, for a long, mad moment, tremble and waver and melt and become compressed into tiny, brilliant points of light, and pulse and throb &#8212; that on such occasions wise mariners never put out of port, for how can one steer? &#8212; that murrain-eels taint the water, which, once drunk of, turns the drinker into a homophage: rogue, mad, a skulker, solitary, incapable of sustaining his brute life on any food but men’s flesh, and that but new-dead &#8212; that Earth-flux is when that fixed dark corner of the sky which conceals the gate of Human Hell changes form and moves &#8212; Avram Davidson, The Island Under the Earth (p.46)_ _","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"quotes","slug":"quotes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/quotes/"},{"name":"cannibalism","slug":"cannibalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/cannibalism/"}]},{"title":"We need a monkey year...","slug":"we-need-a-monkey-year","date":"2016-01-01T21:16:24.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/we-need-a-monkey-year/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/we-need-a-monkey-year/","excerpt":"It has been a contradictory and confusing year, 2015.

You’d think that a total eclipse occurring when the moon passes closest to Earth only happens, say … once every generation. Oh snap! Barely once in a generation. I’ve been thinking back to the last time I saw such a moon: it was on the deck of my small double-ender boat in Queensway Bay, Long Beach, California. That little motor-sailer, with it’s oak frames and cedar planks was converted from a decommissioned Navy lifeboat into a 30 foot day sailer. I bought it in decrepit condition as it was rotting and sinking in Naples Marina, and had it hauled out onto the dry-dock at Seal Beach Harbor; but that’s a different story! I remember standing on the deck, bobbing in the darkness as the water gently sloshed the hull, and how the mooring lines occasionally twanged when the boat rocked a certain way. It was a mostly clear night. The lights of Los Angeles were far enough so that the huge blood red moon was fully visible overhead. Thin strands of cloud seemed to slither behind and above the grayed out, slightly sinister lunar disk. That vision of the ochre and crimson moon had me completely mesmerized. I was scarcely aware of the chilling breeze over the water, the chiming halyards of the sailboat masts, and of the hours passing. That eerie night, early in the Reagan years, is burned into my mind forever. Thirty-three years ago! This time around, Sophia and I camped out on our dining room floor, with pillows and beach blankets. I swung open the plastic thermal-pane windows, which have a hinge that lets them tilt freely out of the their frame. This gave us a clear line of sight, unobstructed by glass panes, trees, or clouds, so that we could look directly up at the mighty and mysterious glowing orb. It was just as strange as the first time I’d seen a blood moon, and we couldn’t resist letting out a few wolf howls now and then. Another blood moon, another howling. Another boost for the eternal popularity of werewolves. Jeez, even Ubuntu has turned into a Wily Werewolf all of a sudden. “What’s a good werewolf yarn?” I thought, rummaging through my overflowing stacks of SF novels. I loved Lycanthia by Tanith Lee, and enjoyed Tim Powers Anubis Gates, but I wanted something I hadn’t read before. Jack Williamson’s Darker Than You Think was the obvious choice, and I was delighted to discover that this is really the best book I’ve ever read from that stalwart SF author. Williamson’s characters are always solid, his plots riveting, and his settings believable. What I didn’t expect was the graceful prose and transcendental consciousness of the shape-shifters in Darker Than You Think. Williamson takes his protagonist, a mediocre reporter named Will Barbee, from his self-pitying drunken existence, and runs him up and down the scales of doubt, suspicion, paranoia, fear and terror &#8212; and ultimately beyond his own psychic limitations, into a realm of predatory, savage ferocity, even madness! In fact, I would say that the book Darker Than You Think transcends the run-of-the-mill science fiction thriller genre and verges on higher planes of literary merit, just like the book’s characters, who escape their physical bodies to become wild beasts of the night. It is not so much in the solid and straight-forward narrative that the book shines, but in the weird places that Williamson takes us in the course of this traditional narrative. When Barbee becomes a wolf, the readers are sent reeling drunkenly through the intensified smells of the night; when he shape-shifts into a snake, our stomach muscles go twitching across the soil and the grass; when he slashes out to kill, we taste the horrible sweetness of human blood! These scenes are so effortlessly knocked out, in his usual pulp style, we can almost relish what a great time Williamson must have had writing this book. In this book, all of Williamson’s inhibitions are cast aside. He gleefully gallops through the woods at midnight, with a gorgeous naked woman clinging to his back. He is goaded onwards to find the darkest, cruelest parts of his mind, turned into a blood-thirsty ravening beast. Another blood moon, another howling! Weaving together the fantastic images of eroticism and violence, Williamson also provides plenty of plot twists. At one point, the main character checks himself into an insane asylum, trying to stave off his transformation, which he nervously assumes cannot be real and must be a symptom of his troubled mind. Oh, the reader knows quite clearly that those dreams are perfectly real! But the wonderful tension that is drawn out between Barbee, the asylum’s psychologist, and the femme fatale is written with such delight, you can’t help but be aware of the author himself in these scenes, roaring with laughter and banging the keys of the typewriter with maniacal amusement. Ultimately, Darker Than You Think, lives up to its title. It does not deliver the typical good-guy-punch-in-the-jaw ending, but dashes off into unexpected zones of strangeness. The inescapable conclusion is just as Curt Siodmak said, in his Wolfman script: Even a man who is pure by heart And says his prayers by night May become a wolf When the wolfbane blooms and the Autumn Moon is bright.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"psychology","slug":"psychology","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/psychology/"},{"name":"moon","slug":"moon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/moon/"},{"name":"occult","slug":"occult","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/occult/"},{"name":"werewolves","slug":"werewolves","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/werewolves/"}]},{"title":"MICE swarm in University Hall:  Mass Independent Comix Expo 2015","slug":"mice-swarm-in-university-hall","date":"2015-10-18T22:20:57.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/mice-swarm-in-university-hall/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/mice-swarm-in-university-hall/","excerpt":"The MICE invasion of Cambridge was a swarming crowd of anarchistic fun.

Yo, MICE artists, kudos to the whole lot of you! You are giant mice among scampering human conformists, in my book. As I wandered around, I talked with Holly Foltz and Jerel Dye, picking up Dye’s two issues of One Android, with their robot vs. sea monster and robot stuck on a desert island themes. As I happened to currently be reading the anthology Pseudo People, I guess I couldn’t resist those android comics. They had a nice use of contrast and were painted with brush and ink. Another interesting discovery was the artist Sally Cantirino, who was busily painting a commission page in someone’s con sketchpad. I liked the boldness of her attack on the clean page, and starting flipping through her mini-zines. The one I liked best was Wise Blood, which was a series of female portraits with an occult mystical theme. Her style is bold and has the sort of internal asymmetrical energy of Paul Pope. The signature she sketched on the inside cover for me was the best of the show! It was an unexpected treat to meet Robert Sikoryak. His twisted psychological mash-ups of classic novels and superheros comics were some of the greatest stuff I encountered in Drawn and Quarterly. In particular his reworking of Crime and Punishment, with Raskolinikov as Batman, is an image that will stay burned in my mind forever. Now he has collected the whole series of those mash-ups in a book, Masterpiece Comics, well worth the price of admission. At MICE, he signed for me a copy of his newest mini-zine &#8212; Sadistic Comics &#8212; published by Rotland Press, as Rotland Dreadfuls #10. This is a great little comic which recasts Wonder Woman from Sensation Comics as Justine from the novel by Marquis de Sade. Each page is a single panel that portrays Wonder Woman / Justine in some sadistic situation as a series of psuedo covers. As usual, Sikoryak’s peculiar social commentary and humor is over the top strange, disturbing, and hilarious. The only panel I attended at MICE was the Black Independent Comics and Cartoonists Panel, moderated by Tony Davis of Million Year Picnic fame, and including Whit Taylor, John Jennings, Ben Passamore, Joel Gill and Micheline Hess. Tony kicked off the session by recalling his growing up with comics, buying them in his Los Angeles neighborhood from a black-owned bookshop owned by Mr. Hall, and his forays up to Hollywood where a black high-school student worked at Burt Blum’s famous comic book section of the Cherokee Book Shop. In this sense, Tony felt as if his own experience of reading and buying comics was a normal part of his black community, even though the characters in the comics were almost all white people. Burt Blum in the original Cherokee Book Shop Comics Section&nbsp; The panelists then spent time introducing themselves and their experiences in growing up with comics and the point at which they were able to connect with black characters in comics. Joel Gill thought it was the character Spawn, whose skin was ripped off and altered by a series of cosmic events, but who was actually an African-American, that was able to transcend the white and black stereotypes pervading the comic book pantheon. The author of Spawn, Todd MacFarlane, has explained his motivation in creating the character Spawn, in which he deliberately set out to remove the concept of race, as seen in the color of a person’s skin. Ben Passamore had a similar reaction to Spawn, though John Jenning’s said the character he related to most was Daredevil, the white blind lawyer &#8212; not in terms of his race, but in terms of his attitude. Daredevil was the guy who didn’t really have any superpower, except that he just didn’t know when to stop. He was the “Man Without Fear,” who overcame his handiciap to swing around on cables and take on all opponents. For Jennings, it was that fearless attitude of never giving up that he related to most. Whit Taylor talked about growing up in a mostly white part of New Jersey, reading Archie Comics, and wondering why the characters Chuck Clayton and Nancy Woods were so totally devoid of personalities. It was as if those characters had no black identity at all, and this made Whit wonder what a real African American comic book protagonist should be like. The solution, of course, was to create her own comics and characters! Micheline, who arrive some 45 minutes late to the panel, had an appropriate analogy about her experience of black characters in comics. She said that in trying to identify with characters in comics, black people felt like “showing up to a banquet where everyone is already seated and eating. You can stand there and have something to eat, but even though nobody will ask you to leave, what you really want is to make yourself a place at the table with everyone else!“ Tony Davis added: “Or it’s like showing up to a whole series of banquets where the food is always the same.” Some of the recommended links and venues that the panelists mentioned to find out more about black independent comic creators were: Afro Future Fest Black Comic Book Festival (held at the NYPL Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture) Black Comix Arts Festival Black Science Fiction Society Cartoonist of Color Database Peepgamecomix.com After the panel session, I went to look for Ben Passamore. His art really knocked me out, so I picked up both issues of DAY GLO AY HOLE and a mini-comic called Goodbye. Ben’s work is something that I would call deeply human and angst-ridden, addressing the world we live in from a philosophical perspective that I found interesting and refreshing. On the Black Independents panel, Ben remarked that growing up he felt very isolated and lonely. He said: “I made violent and lonely comix when I was a kid, and I guess I still do.” About how his readers approach him he also said “Since my comics are so intensely personal, my blackness might be subjugated by the uncomfortable personal things that I write about.” I could certainly relate to what he was saying, and I highly recommend taking some time to check out his stuff. Once again, MICE, nibbled away at the status quo, leaving tooth marks on the shiny, brain-dead culture of corporate America. Power to the Independents, and power to the people who support their fellow humans!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"comics","slug":"comics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/comics/"},{"name":"anarchism","slug":"anarchism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/anarchism/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"androids","slug":"androids","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/androids/"},{"name":"equality","slug":"equality","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/equality/"}]},{"title":"Russian Science Fiction Oddities from the John H.

Costello, who passed away in early 2015, was donated to fandom recently at Readercon 26. Here I will take a quick look at some of the Russian language materials that I found among Costello’s collection. As I was digging through these large stacks of books, David Hartwell mentioned that Costello was a translator, so my attention was drawn to the foreign language books in the stacks, primarily in Russian and German. After a little bit of follow-up research, I found out that Costello indeed had translated some of the works of Russian SF author, Kir Bulychev. One of the items I found among the piles of old zines was Bulychev’s poetry collection Chto nashe zhizn? [What is our life?]. This wasn’t particularly interesting, aside from the inscription to Costello inside the front cover, and the odd choices of clip art used to illustrate the poems. I couldn’t quite figure out the poems: In the world of little people, Many of the usual whores. But there are these whores Less - aunt, More - uncle. More interesting for me was the gorgeous copy of Technika Molodezhni (April 1975). I have always admired the gorgeous covers of this long-running magazine, but the copy I found in Costello’s collection is the first one I have actually held in my hands. It has all sorts of interesting contents and deserves a post of it’s own (coming soon!) Definitely the most spectacular item I found was the Russian edition of Heinlein’s “Door into Summer“ [Dver v leta]. The wonderful cover art is uncredited. Nonetheless the glittering green eyes of the black cat over the sleeping astronaut are amazing and unforgettable! Then there was the cartoonists collection that I found called Joking Aside [Shutki v storonu] from 1991. This is quite an interesting period for Soviet cartoonists, as they were testing the waters of Glasnost. I particularly liked the cartoons of Garif Bacyrov (1944-2004). According to his biography on the Tretyakov Gallery website, he was born in Kazakhstan at Akmolinsky Prison Camp for the wives of men who were accused of betraying their country. This perhaps explains the intensity of his images, like the wrecking ball cracking open the shoulder of an anthropomorphic brick building. Another cartoonist I liked in this book was Mikhael Zlatkovskii, who also had a cynical sense of humor, of the type you might find in Zap Comix. This iconic illustration &#8212; apparently about the dangers of prostitution &#8212; also appeared in other publications around the same time. Then there was the humorous illustration of two opposing camps of protestors. The farm animals marching under the sign: “BREAD!” facing off against humans who are marching under the sign “MEAT!” Somehow, this illustration by I. Novikov seems relevant today, too, in the context of animal rights &amp; veganism against carnivores. But I don’t really know what it meant in Russia in 1990… For the curious you can download the whole book of Joking Aside as a PDF. From the fannish perspective, probably the most historically interesting find was a copy of FENZOR #1, a Russian fanzine edited by Sergei Berezhnoi and published in May 1990. This is just the coolest little fanzine (about 11 x 14cm in size), very nicely printed in crisp type and with neat line drawings. The inscription shows that the editor was keen to share the premiere issue of FENZOR with his first American friend, John (Costello)! By far the strangest item I found in Costello’s collection was a custom-made fannish pinback button featuring a Japanese manga-style vampire. The vampire appears above the balloon-style font that says: KISS [Nimta]. On the upper left, in the vampire’s hair, are the letters NTTM, which I am guessing as referring to the &lt;a href=”https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%91%D0%B6%D0%B8” target=”blank”&gt;Tsentr nauchno-tekhnicheskogo tvorchestva molodozhi, or the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity of Youth. This NTTM seems worty of further research. It appears to have been the legacy institution built to replace the old Komsomol (Young Pioneers) of the Soviet Union, as a way to promote the sciences for young people in the new Russia. Apparently it was built on the crumbling and despirited edifice of the Communist cadre system. One can only assume that the usage here on this badge is tongue-in-cheek, and a sort of snarky reference to the “authority” of their fannish mission. The text encircling the badge is more what I would expect: “Unusual research into the Mystical, Fantastic, and Absurd [Neobychnyye Issledovaniya Mistika Fantastika Absurd].” The transition of Science Fiction fandom from the Soviet period to the Russian Federation, has got to be interesting, though I know so little about it. These lucky finds among the items of John H. Costello’s library are the first window I have had on this bit of fannish history. Hopefully these leads will take me down some interesting pathways.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"fandom","slug":"fandom","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/fandom/"},{"name":"zines","slug":"zines","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/zines/"},{"name":"cartoonists","slug":"cartoonists","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/cartoonists/"},{"name":"Russia","slug":"Russia","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/Russia/"}]},{"title":"Readercon 2015:  Veering Towards Pluto","slug":"readercon-2015-veering-towards-pluto","date":"2015-07-14T01:27:30.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/readercon-2015-veering-towards-pluto/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/readercon-2015-veering-towards-pluto/","excerpt":"Readercon is generally my favorite con of the year, and in 2015 Readercon was up to the usual standard of fun times and excellence. The guests of honor Nicola Griffith and Gary K Wolfe were on hand throughout, and the memorial GOH was Joanna Russ. How could you go wrong? Indeed there were no less than three sessions on the life and work of Joanna Russ, including the participation of the author’s long-time associates: Jim Freund, David Hartwell, Michael Dirda, Ron Drummond, and Samuel R. Delany. Freund told some great stories about the early days of his career at WBAI Radio in New York, when he was literally living in the station offices, and broadcasting his radio show, “Hour of the Wolf,” five days a week at 5:00am. One time Freund called up Russ at about 8pm and invited her to join him for an interview on Hour of the Wolf. Russ declined the interview, but she did invite him out to eat at a nearby diner. The meal turned into an eight hour long conversation. Finally, having talked through the night, at about 4:30am, Russ asked to stop over at the Radio Station to use the bathroom on her way home, while Freund was getting ready for his show. Just as he was going live, Russ stopped by the control room to wave good-bye, and she heard Freund say into the microphone: “This is the Hour of the Wolf, and my guest today is Joanna Russ.” The first words Russ spoke on that particular live broadcast were: “You motherfucker! I’m going to kill you!” Which she subsequently did, by killing off the character based on Freund in her novel, We Who Are About To.","text":"Readercon is generally my favorite con of the year, and in 2015 Readercon was up to the usual standard of fun times and excellence.

I’m going to kill you!” Which she subsequently did, by killing off the character based on Freund in her novel, We Who Are About To. Michael Dirda reminisced about his days at Cornell, where he and Joanna Russ became friends, and how she gave him a crash course in Science Fiction criticism when he first began to review SF for the Washington Post. David Hartwell told stories about what a dynamic and fun person Russ was to be around, for example, the night when she corralled some of her fellow writers and got them all to contribute lines to a story that she decided to compose on the spot: _Useful Phrases for the Tourist_ (1972) In this pastiche of a tourist booklet, we find some memorable lines such as: “Madam, this bed/nest is alive,” “My head is not interchangeable,” and “At what hour does the lovelorn princess fling herself into the flaming volcano? May we participate?.” Hartwell pointed this out as a way of balancing the customary view of Russ as determined, combative, and intense. She was all those things too, as Ron Drummond added with a short reading of a wonderful anecdote from his student days at University of Washington. In one of Russ’s lectures, she explained to her students how Herman Melville’s career trajectory took a downward spiral after the dismal sales of Moby Dick; ironically, the most famous of his works more than a century after his death. While his advance payments had been continuously rising up until Moby Dick, in his subsequent novel, Pierre, they shrank, and when he submitted the following novel, Isle of the Cross, his publisher actually rejected the manuscript. Furious at this turn of events Melville burned not only the submitted manuscript for Isle of the Cross, but all of his draft copies and notes as well, thus destroying the book for all time. At this point of the lecture, Joanna Russ said that if she had a time machine, she would travel back to to visit that author. Not in order to save the manuscript of Isle of the Cross from the flames, but to strangle Melville for having destroyed it. This image of Joanna Russ, acting out the strangling of Herman Melville in front of the classroom by wringing his imaginary neck, was the perfect characterization of her intense relationship with literature and and a demonstration of her passion to correct the errors of literary history. Another great panel this year was a tribute to the publication of Dhalgren by Samuel R. Delany, first published forty years ago in the famous Bantam Paperback edition. Dhalgren is an intense book, to which each person has their own unique and strong reactions. Shira Lipkin said that she first encountered Dhalgren after ending up in Las Vegas, Nevada, and living with a rough crowd of drug-using punks. “I was having my personal apocalypse at the time, so it seemed to make perfect sense to enter the city of Bellona.” John Stevens discovered Dhalgren when he asked a teacher, who had been giving him science fiction recommendations, to suggest something “more challenging.” What the teacher gave him was Dhalgren. “That set the bar very high,” Stevens said, “and when I finished Dhalgren, I asked for something else to read on the same level of literary excellence and challenge. At which point he handed me a copy of Ulysses. So as it turned out, Dhalgren not only turned me on to the possibilities of science fiction, but to highest standards of literature itself.“ There were several other really great panels that I attended, including one on Mystery and Speculative Fiction Crossovers. In the Mystery panel, Greer Gilman was in fine form, reeling off observations such as: “Fantasy reifies metaphors. There really is a black tarantula on that slice of angel food cake!” Or: “In the SFnal mystery story there is an underlying tension between the soluble and the insoluble. You can actually solve the mystery, but you cannot solve the World that you are in.“ Then in the Anthropocene panel, contemplating the fate of our own planet Earth, Michael Daley asked: “Are we merely mammals? Or as Human Beings will we make use of our consciousness to stop these destructive behaviors in time to save our species?” Vandana Singh, a particle-physicist by training, had some great points to make in this session. “Are we in the Anthropocene, or in the Capitalocene? What we are missing in Capitalism (and all the other -isms) is the relationship of humanity to Nature. Can we remove the delusion of being separated from Nature in time to save ourselves? We must decide, do we want a world that is hot as Hell and completely unlivable? Or do we want a world that is very inhospitable, but where we can at least scrape by as a species? I think this is an opportunity for SF writers to show their revolutionary potential. By presenting scenarios of survival as communities, we can inform people of the chances that humans may still have.” Deluca was less optimistic: “What is SF’s revolutionary potential? I’m skeptical about us writers being able to change these enormous systems that are firmly entrenched.” Michael J. Daley wondered: “What is the best motivator (as a theme in SF)? The terror of total destruction, or hope for technological solutions? Maybe in the latter category we could think about Solarpunk…” Vandana Singh concluded: “Technological solutions to global climate change won’t work unless they include social solutions. The bottom line for or survival right now is that we must get off our addiction to fossil fuels.” Wandering around the con, I ended up chatting with Frank Wu and Ted Chiang. Wu asked Chiang how he came up with the idea for the story Exhalation (published in Lightspeed). Ted said there were two main inspirations for the story, the first being P. K. Dick’s story The Electric Ant, which begins with the protagonist injuring his arm and going to see the doctor to have it patched up. The doctor scans him and says: “Well, I can’t treat you because you are a robot, so you will have to go see a robot repair specialist.” Shocked to discover that he is not a human being, the protagonist gets his arm fixed at the robot repair place then goes home to look up his own specifications on the central computer. Given a certain sequence of pressure points, he then proceeds to open himself up. His midriff splits open and he is astonished to see, in fact, that he is a robot, full of wires and clockwork mechanisms, at the center of which is a small punch-tape slowly unreeling through a spool. The second inspiration for Exhalation was in a section of a novel where there is a long digression about the physical nature of the Universe, and in which it is explained that people don’t eat food to obtain energy. It is pointed out that food is a very low entropy energy source, and that having eaten food, people actually radiate heat and energy at a much higher rate of entropy. This low energy to high energy phase change is what inspired Chiang for the argon in Exhalation. This was a great introduction to Chiang’s story, which I read the same night and very much enjoyed. Especially the way in which Chiang adapted the P. K. Dick idea of the robot opening his mechanism up to look inside. In Exhalation, the main character sets up an elaborate surgical apparatus so that: “I would then be able to dissect my own brain… the most beautifully complex engine I had ever beheld.” Very interesting! One unexpected event at this year’s Readercon, was a whole room full of free books. Long time fan, John H. Costello, passed away in 2015, and his book collection was set up for anyone to sort through and take home. Costello, in addition to be an archeologist, was a translator, who published some English editions of the Russian SF author, Kir Bulychev. Among the cool finds that I dug out of the various piles and boxes of Costello’s collection, was a rare copy of _Chto nashe zhizn?_ [What is our life?] … the signed copy #32 out of an edition of 500 copies. This strange little book, along with some other eye-catching treats from back in the USSR that I found in the Costello collection, are worth pursuing in a follow up post, so keep tuned to channel Yunchtime! And thanks to John Costello, who seems to have been a fellow that I would have enjoyed talking to, and whom I regret not having met on this particular journey. Mixing with the great people in attendance, of course, is what makes the con. And I really enjoyed catching up with Dianne Weinstein, Mark Borok, Chip Delany, George Morgan, Arielle Saiber, Neil Clarke, Scott Edelman, Darrell Schweitzer, and Ed Koenig. I also met two editors, Tom Easton and Will Whalley. It’s hard to wind down afterwards, and realize that a whole trip around the sun will transpire before Readercon 27. Considering the recent Sad and Rabid Puppies slates kerfluffle, which swept up many fanac hours over recent months, Readercon was completely upbeat. I barely heard any mention of the Hugo slate controversy, with the exception of a few comments in the Who Owns SF panel. It was really a relaxcon this year, possibly helped along by a bunch of fans kicking up their heels at the 80s dance. For me, it was a fine new pile of treasures to read, and a fine time with my fellow travelers of the SFnal Universe.

At that time, Harry’s friend and fellow artist, Leslie Hall, was working in the same office as my father.

Here was someone who I could talk to about the Franju film, _Yeux sans Visage_ [Eyes Without a Face], and who not only knew the film, but knew the horror of it, on a deeply personal level. Harry seemed to be practically a hermit. He lived in an old house near a bread factory just SE of downtown Albuquerque. The place was nestled in a semi-industrial strip next to I-25, and was always slightly aromatic of freshly-baked bread wafting from the industrial vents of the nearby Butterkrust bread factory. In those days, the thing that struck me most about Harry Morris was that he had somehow become deeply affected with a sense of total dread for the Universe and all it’s inhabitants. He wasn’t just goofing around, trying to get sympathy, or trying to put on an act of being cool, aloof, or mysterious. Harry actually had some kind of terrifying inner knowledge about the dark side of the Universe that naturally drew him to the works of H. P. Lovecraft. He was able to explore his own consciousness with an extreme sensitivity to terror, to dread, to the sense of fear and trembling that grabs us when we know &#8212; deep in our bones &#8212; that something is very wrong about this plane of existence. The way we perceive reality, if you ask me, is not only a misinterpretation, but more of a collective delusion, salted by our own personal blind spots. Hiding around the edges of this, the elder Gods are creeping in, they are squishing their narcotic tentacles into the tubes of our brain… while the music of the spheres is grinding away like machinery with misaligned gears. In my opinion, this is why Harry (and many of the rest of us) so appreciated artworks that explored the apprehension of these darker places in our consciousness. Take for example, the movie Eraserhead by David Lynch. The off-key, and awkward moments of our lives &#8212; when our essential misfit with the rest of space and time becomes a little too obvious &#8212; that is the space where Harry O. lives. That is where his art comes from, and his eery ability to get under our skin. He’s a genius really. He is the only practicing and totally uncompromising surrealist I have ever met. And for that I will always thank him! It was a treat to sit around, in those days, with Harry and Leslie, working on collages, or making up “exquisite corpse” poems, in which we would take turns creating the weirdest Gothic horror doggerel you can imagine. Both Harry and Leslie were the only two people I knew who both spoke and lived the language of surrealism. They were always introducing me to new writers and artists, like Yves Tanguy (suddenly Richard Powers had a context!), or Le Comte de Lautreamont and his nightmare classic, Les Chants de Maldoror. I picked up a Grove paperback edition of this over at the Living Batch bookstore, and was at once mesmerized by its dark and misanthropic aspects. What really amazed me was the quality of the art and writing that these “unknowns” were creating for Nyctalops, which Harry was publishing himself (as the Silver Scarab Press). There were drawings and photo-montages lying around on Harry’s production table by people like Bill McCabe, J.K. Potter, alongside of typeset stories by G. Sutton Brieding and editorials by Harry Morris that blew me away. These guys could write in their own voice! I started to appreciate and understand the connections between Poe, Verlaine, Huysmans, Rimbaud, Vian, Gracq, and H. P. Lovecraft. I suppose the main thing I got out this was the fact that writing didn’t just “happen” like spontaneous combustion, but was a continuous process involving the author and his readers. Sometimes the readers who provided feedback were only a few immediate friends. Sometimes they were correspondents you’d never met. And so you end up with Harry discovering the works of Thomas Ligotti, and being so convinced of their quality, he decided to print them himself on the underground equipment of Silver Scarab Press. The rest of that story is history! Since putting aside the old Gestetner mimeo machine, Harry had assembled the pieces of a high quality photo-offset printing plant. In 1979 or 1980, while I was living in New York City, I asked Harry to print up 100 copies of a cover that I was planning to use for a Science Fiction zine, called Black Hole SF. It was an interesting collage done by Leslie Hall, who had kindly given me permission to use it. Too bad that I was too busy dropping out of college and never got around to publishing the zine, though I still have the perfectly printed covers that Harry sent me. Soon after dropping out of college, I washed up in Albuquerque again, and in the Spring of 1981 Harry sold me his old mimeograph, which had been collecting dust in the corner of his basement. I promptly named the machine Blond Beest, and starting printing copies of an anarchist zine called Magickal Dispatch. Unfortunately, it was not really up to any standard, and was soon abandoned. But I have to hand it again to Harry O., who was quite willing to sell me his old Gestetner, even on the flimsy premise that an unemployed college drop-out was going to be able to publish an anarchist zine. Harry was always innovating. He had amassed a bunch of great old-school printing equipment in his basement, including a large format copy camera, typesetter, light-tables, and some primordial digital equipment that he was using to invent his own processes. He loved to posterize images to the point at which they became blurry abstractions, and he loved to screen images to give them grainy textures. Most of this he did with traditional photographic and pre-press screening techniques. But Harry was also an early adopter of digital technology. Although he claims to not know much about computers, he was tinkering with them even in the early 1980s, using an Amiga, probably ten years before I owned my first cheap Windows box (running DOS 3.1). One of the digital gizmos Harry set up was an old surplus CCTV video monitor, of the kind used at banks for security cameras. There was a long delay of the the response time as the cheap sensor recorded vertical lines and processed them through DigiView software (running on his Amiga) to a thermal paper printer. Once when I was visiting Harry in the early 1980s he set up the monitor and took an exposure, in which I was to hold very still for about ten seconds, then slowly turn my head to the side. This delay caused the resulting image to be very weird indeed. Harry has a knack for figuring out how surreal and distorted images can be used to powerful effect, without simply making them into unintelligible nonsense. He is always carefully testing and noodling around to get the exact image that he is after, which is a personal thing for him. It reminds me of Castenada’s lucid dreaming practice, in which you are trying to see and control your own hands in a dream. Harry is continuously pursuing this phantom image in his mind, taking inspiration from Max Ernst, Satty, Franju, and other surrealists. As Breton himself set out in the Manifesto: I believe in the future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surreality, if one may so speak. .. We really live by our fantasies when we give free reign to them. What I still admire about Harry O. Morris is the free reign that he gives to his own imagination. Of course, he is not immune to the slings and arrows of daily life, and has to put up with the general dread and malaise of living in the same world of greedy, violent idiots as the rest of us. But he never once gave in to the status quo. Harry lives life the way he chooses to live it. And he does so with a flair and a panache that reflects his own tastes and (sometimes morbid) humor. At the entry of his house there used to be an old sliced open basketball, mounted on a globe stand, and with its skin peeled away in long irregular strips. Even as you walk through the door of his house you are punched in the nose with a metaphor: a world in decay, rotten and dissected for you to plainly see! And as you turn to face strangeness upon strangeness, you enter Harry’s place: where the candelabras reach out from the walls to light your way, and beasts sit gently snorting streams of smoke on the other side of the mirror. This is Harry’s place! With a tower shaped like a witch’s hat on top, and circled round by a fence made of blackened cast iron spikes. Thanks for this reality that you fashioned in the midst of utter mediocrity, Harry, for this surreality that is it’s own transcendental path to other worlds! When I was still a whipper-snapper and hadn’t seen much, you demonstrated beyond any doubt the lasting strength of being oneself, come Hell or high water. It has benefited me ever since. Now, as the new Centipede Press _Artists Portfolio_ will attest, the bizarre and arresting visuals of Harry O. Morris are in a class to themselves!

How strange it is to collapse our life experience into a series of new devices and how they affected us, and then try to imagine what it is like to be born digital, with all this shiny stuff that has no historical context. As Peter Goldman said: “Between the twitterverse and the 24-hour cable news cycle our history keeps disappearing.” Now, everything is instantaneous, all knowledge is free, one-to-one communication is a such a waste of time… “duh! old timer, how can you be so passé.” This got me thinking about the impact of earlier communication technologies and what they were like in the popular culture before they were taken for granted. What was it like 100 years ago, when the telephone was first established as a fixture of modern life? In 1880, there had only been 108,000 telephones in use, by 1890 there were 467,000 telephones installed. Think of the rapid change as this newfangled device penetrated American society. 1900 600,000 (for 76,000,000 people) reaching 0.79% of the population 1905 2,200,000 (for 83,000,000 people) reaching 2.6% of the population 1910 5,800,000 (for 92,000,000 people) reaching 6.3% of the population During the first 25 years of its existence the telephone was physically accessible to less than 1% of the population, but that number nearly tripled between 1900 and 1905, then doubled again, between 1905 and 1910. This exponential growth, and the exposure of greater and greater numbers of people to this technology &#8212; which could project their voice instantly to almost anywhere &#8212; must indeed have seemed like magic, like something from mythology come to life! So it was not surprising to find an advertisement in the 1914 Farm Journal in which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company actually portrayed their service in mythological terms. AT&amp;T was established only nine years earlier, in 1885, and by 1914 they had been riding a totally unparalleled explosion of telephony…and yet, from their point of view, they had more than 90% of the population left to capture as customers! How to capture their imagination and then their money? That must have been the operating question for the AT&amp;T publicity machine of the time.

How strange it is to collapse our life experience into a series of new devices and how they affected us, and then try to imagine what it is like to be born digital, with all this shiny stuff that has no historical context. As Peter Goldman said: “Between the twitterverse and the 24-hour cable news cycle our history keeps disappearing.” Now, everything is instantaneous, all knowledge is free, one-to-one communication is a such a waste of time… “duh! old timer, how can you be so passé.” This got me thinking about the impact of earlier communication technologies and what they were like in the popular culture before they were taken for granted. What was it like 100 years ago, when the telephone was first established as a fixture of modern life? In 1880, there had only been 108,000 telephones in use, by 1890 there were 467,000 telephones installed. Think of the rapid change as this newfangled device penetrated American society. 1900 600,000 (for 76,000,000 people) reaching 0.79% of the population 1905 2,200,000 (for 83,000,000 people) reaching 2.6% of the population 1910 5,800,000 (for 92,000,000 people) reaching 6.3% of the population During the first 25 years of its existence the telephone was physically accessible to less than 1% of the population, but that number nearly tripled between 1900 and 1905, then doubled again, between 1905 and 1910. This exponential growth, and the exposure of greater and greater numbers of people to this technology &#8212; which could project their voice instantly to almost anywhere &#8212; must indeed have seemed like magic, like something from mythology come to life! So it was not surprising to find an advertisement in the 1914 Farm Journal in which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company actually portrayed their service in mythological terms. AT&amp;T was established only nine years earlier, in 1885, and by 1914 they had been riding a totally unparalleled explosion of telephony…and yet, from their point of view, they had more than 90% of the population left to capture as customers! How to capture their imagination and then their money? That must have been the operating question for the AT&amp;T publicity machine of the time. And here is what they came up with: The Magic Flight of Thought Ages ago, Thor, the champion of the Scandinavian gods, invaded Jotunheim, the land of the giants and was challenged to feats of skill by Loki, the king. Thor matched Thialfi, the swiftest of mortals, against Hugi in a footrace. Thrice they swept over the course, but each time Thialfi was hopelessly defeated by Loki’s runner. Loki confessed to Thor afterwards that he had deceived the god by enchantments, saying, “Hugi was my thought, and what speed can ever equal his?” But the flight of thought is no longer a magic power of mythical beings, for the Bell Telephone has made it a common daily experience. Over the telephone, the spoken thought is transmitted instantly, directly where we send it, outdistancing every other means for carrying of messages. In the Bell System, the telephone lines reach throughout the country, and the thoughts of the people are carried with lightning speed in all directions, one mile, a hundred, or two thousand miles away. And because the Bell System so adequately served the practical needs of the people, the magic of thought’s swift flight occurs 25,000,000 times every twenty-four hours. &nbsp; What a fascinating text! It appeared in Farm Journal, Feb 1914, p. 142. Can we be pardoned to take a little semiotic glance at this stuff? Summoning the gods themselves, Ma Bell pits the champion Thor against the cunning Loki. Thor, the simple honest hard-working champion, doesn’t think of riding the skies on his uru-hammer, but puts an ordinary mortal on the ground to run the course as his surrogate. In other words, Thor cannot think beyond the manifestation of his physical body, and must toil against gravity, against distance, against steep slopes. Thor is the eternal mail-carrier, battering his way forward against the snow, the rain, the heat, and gloom of night. Just as it ever was, since Ancient Persian times, or earlier, the imperative of moving information through physical dimensions of space has decided the fate of humans and their societies. By contrast, the wily and diabolical Loki projects his thoughts over the same course, and thoughts &#8212; like electrons! &#8212; travel instantly, leaving no tracks and without muddying the wings of anybody’s sandals. Here, we can see that Loki transcends the physical body, the physical landscape, with all their sordid geometries and limitations. Loki casts off the body in favor of pure instantaneous thought, which can cover any distance without friction &#8212; Loki operates on the astral plane! And obviously Ma Bell associates with Loki, keep that in mind. Now how is the potential customer going to interpret this allegory? The flight of thought is no longer a magic power of mythical beings, the Bell Telephone has made it a common daily experience. Let us say they were channeling Arthur C. Clarke from the future, and they could dig the idea that any technology sufficiently advanced cannot be distinguished from magic. Sure. It’s just technology, get used to it! But wait… over the telephone, spoken thought is transmitted instantly, wherever we direct it. The telephone transmits “spoken thought.” What is that? Isn’t it just speech? But this is the diabolical cleverness of Ma Bell. It is the mental activity of thought that is transmitted &#8212; in it’s spoken form, albeit &#8212; but essentially we are engaging not in telephony but in telepathy! Let us think back to 1914. When the telephone was first introduced, it was the hey-day of table rappers, claire-voyants, and theosophists. But Ma Bell wasn’t hanging around with Madame Blavatsky they were delivering telepathy, the instant transmission of spoken thought! That! Was real! The homespun-wearing reader of the Farm Journal, leaning next to a pot-bellied stove in the barn, must have spit a long arc of chaw at this news! After having mortgaged the farm to buy a tractor, so they didn’t get put out of business by the Jones’s over yonder, it must have been rather stimulating to think of being the first feller in the county to have instant communication with anyplace on the continent! Heady stuff indeed. And it was not a fantasy story, like something you’d read in The Popular Magazine. This was now a common daily experience! Note that Ma Bell was advertising in Farm Journal, not just the Wall Street Journal. This was a populist campaign, because they had to hook the 90% of ordinary folks on the telephone. They had to make them realize that without the advantage of their spoken thoughts zapping instantly to any destination, they were a thing of the past. But the ad is so ingenious and non-threatening! It is not the elite with a monopoly on this power, it is the thoughts of the people carried with lightning speed. We are on the side of the masses, then, says the phone company, because the Bell System so adequately served the practical needs of the people, the magic of thought’s swift flight occurs 25,000,000 times every twenty-four hours. This is such interesting stuff! It is all about empowering the ordinary people, who become part of this vast network of thrumming brain-waves, snapping switchboards, and furious activity. Anyone can call anywhere! Their spoken thoughts projected instantly, making physical delivery of information obsolete. On the other hand, I wonder how many phones in those rural general stores were ringing off the hook? Compared say, to the offices of J. P. Morgan Bank, or the President of the United States. Might there actually be some differential in the effectiveness and egalitarianism of this technology? After all, it is Loki inviting us to join in, not Thor! The silver-tongued Loki has, without a doubt, calculated everything in advance! Loki knows that dispersing the general cost of the phone system to the wider population it is going to benefit the rich and the powerful &#8212; those who are being sought after and those who benefit from instant transmission of information. This problem remains with us today. The modern Everyman can trade stocks online with Ameri*trade, or some other abomination from hell. But qui bono, amici? Think of those instant massive trades that transpire in milliseconds, that are run by the insiders, and that steer the market up and down like a puppet on a string. And then keep in mind that none of those damned big brokerage houses are going to pay a penny in fees or taxes on their stolen profits. Meanwhile, you could take all the day-trading suckers put together &#8212; paying per-transaction brokerage fees &#8212; and they are flushing more money into the system to keep it all going. Indeed, when I read this parable of Thor and Loki from 1914, I was not overly critical of the farmers back in the day. I suspect they knew which way is up, and were not fooled into thinking that the telephone was a life or death necessity. What strikes me is how similar the deception is, even to the present day. Years ago, at a telecoms research conference (which I participated in while working at M.I.T.), some British boffin in the BT labs gave a hyper-ventilated stump speech about augmented reality glasses. This was in 1999, so more than ten years before we saw actual products that could deliver augmented reality (ala Google glass launched in 2013). Basically, what he said was that anyone who didn’t have the augmented reality edge, was dead in the water. Who could survive in the shark eat shark world, without knowing instantly the name of the person beside you [from biometric recognition] and know what size shoes they wear, what high school they went to, and if they had knee surgery? Above all, which knee! In case you have to kick it, I suppose. This sort of uber-frenzied and paranoid reality was rather comical to me. And I enjoyed it tremendously when I happened across Accelerando in 2005. But is it really necessary? Now that telephone usage is somewhere OVER 100%, the modern Loki and the modern Ma Bell have been supplanted by Internet services, and more insidiously, social media services. Mark Zuckerberg now considers himself to be connecting the people, to serve them! To help them! Nevermind that he sells the identities, the interests, the habits and secrets of his clients to anyone with money. He is a populist, on a mission to connect all the human beings on the planet in his network of instant spoken thought. The “people” who have now become uber-connected freaks &#8212; yes, those 1.3 billion humans who are registered users of Facebook &#8212; aren’t they somewhat addled and hyperactive? They show all the signs of acute addiction. So what if all that random babbling is instantly commented on from every part of the globe. Is it meaningful? Has the purpose of human life been reduced to the bathos of continuous trivia and virtual contact? Somehow the farmer contemplating the future in 1914 doesn’t seem all that bad to me from my laptop screen in 2015. At least he had some ground to stand on, some pigs to feed, a back field to plow. And today, what have we got? A virtual server on shared hosting that we have to update, a linux kernel to patch, and pingback vulnerability to rid of email spam? This is progress… feh.

The other amazing find in this copy of Kafka’s Parables and Paradoxes, was an original “discount card” from Limelight Bookshop! Around the edge of the card are prices of books, 75 cents along the left, 25 cents the top, 50 cents to the right, and $1 books along the bottom. Punched out of the lower corner of this card are two prices, $1 and 50 cents. The punch-hole is in the shape of the capital letter L &#8212; in a very nice serif font &#8212; hardly the sort of detail that anyone could fake. Also, the Kafka book had a cover price of $1.45, which corresponds with amount punched from the discount card. All in all, this appears to be an artifact of genuine Greenwich Village history! At first, I thought this card was related to The Limelight cafe, gallery, and bookstore, which was founded in 1954 by Helen Gee (nee Wimmers) (1919-2004), a German American New Yorker who married the artist Yun Gee (1906-1963). The bookstore was not only famous as the best cafe to hang out in for artists, writers and intellectuals in the Village, it was also home to the first successful photography art gallery in New York. Helen Gee wrote a well-received memoir about the Limelight, packed with interesting Village history. Like Cafe Cino, the Limelight served as a venue for various performers in it’s day. This photo is supposed to have been taken in the Limelight during a 1965 appearance by comedian Jean Shepherd. Limelight photo 1965, Jean Shepherd (photo by Dave Michelsohn) src When I saw this photo, various details stood out: the bare plywood “stage,” the well stocked bar, bentwood chairs, exposed brick walls, and the general unadorned scruffy interior. However, Helen Gee’s daughter, Li-Lan, has remarked that the cafe never had a licquor license. Indeed, the original Limelight was much swankier! In Helen Gee’s remarkable memoir, there is a photo from May 1954, that shows what the first Limelight looked like. Limelight Restaurant photo by Arthur Levine, May 1954. It was truly elegant. With a lofty ceiling, hanging globes of light, clean white walls, and square lanterns. Those square lanterns do look the same in both photos, except that in the Michelson photo the wiring seems to be from a hideous exposed conduit running up from the floor, which is not at all like the original clean white walls. This is such an odd mystery! Did the Limelight deteriorate into that wretched dive in the span of 11 years? Did it move to a new location where the original lanterns were hacked onto the bare brick walls? A close examination of the architectural plan for the Limelight in Helen Gee’s book shows that the property was a long narrow building running between 7th Avenue South and Barrow Street. The actual addresses would have been 91 South 7th Ave, and 14 Barrow Street. Indeed, Helen attests to being amazed when the bohoes and beatniks showed up in her cafe. She wrote that such boho types were simply never to be seen West of MacDougal street, their usual haunt, where they were as thick as thieves. According to one source, The Limelight closed in January 1961. However, an advertisement (page 3) in the Columbia Daily Spectator lists Limelight Books at 103 MacDougal in their Nov. 3rd, 1960 issue. So Limelight Books at 103 MacDougal may have opened before the original Limelight closed. Indeed, the second incarnation of Limelight Books apparently had nothing to do with Helen Gee’s famous Limelight gallery and cafe… Even so, it would interesting to know more: who opened Limelight Books? How did they end up with the identical lamps (assuming that Dave Michelson’s photo is correctly attributed)? And when did Limelight Books eventually close? This reminded me of my own days in New York, probably half of which I spent wandering the streets and hanging around in the Village. By 1978, when I moved there from New Mexico, the art scene had begun to drift southward to what was then still a warehouse and office district in Soho. There was not so much living theatre as there was punk and new wave music, though nobody called it by those names. Typical hangouts for me on MacDougal Street were Bleecker Bob’s Record Store (when it used to be near the corner of 8th Street) and Cafe Reggio. I can’t remember what, if anything was located at 103 MacDougal in the late 1970s, but I think it is in the building currently taken over by Panchito’s Restaurant. This lucky find at the bookstore took me on a pleasant little excursion into psycho-geography and the history of the Village art scene. Can’t you picture the original owner of this book? They must have visited Greenwich Village in 1962 and stopped in to see the famous beatnik scene. Browsing the photos on exhibit and the racks of books at the Limelight, how much fun it must have been to buy a copy of Franz Kafka, and to get the little discount card… something which they could never really use, but just for the memento. And then to drift around the corner up Bleecker Street to Cornelia, to catch the avant-garde Ionesco show at Caffe Cino. So romantic, really. And how appropriate for these historical images to hinge upon a few scraps of paper falling out of a Franz Kafka book 52 years later!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"journalism","slug":"journalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/journalism/"},{"name":"beatniks","slug":"beatniks","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/beatniks/"},{"name":"bookshops","slug":"bookshops","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/bookshops/"}]},{"title":"Ka-chow!  sneezes the roscoe.","slug":"ka-chow-sneezes-the-roscoe","date":"2014-07-24T08:16:13.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/ka-chow-sneezes-the-roscoe/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/ka-chow-sneezes-the-roscoe/","excerpt":"The opening of Jack Womack’s _Going Going Gone_, injects us into an unpredictable world that wobbles between an alternate hipster-scene of New York City in the 1960s and the seemingly hallucinatory ramblings of a drug-addled protagonist, Walter Bullitt.

But the narrator is more like one of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers than a secret agent, and he himself was so startled by the phone that he almost made for the john to “drown his bagged cat.” To flush his pot down the toilet, get it? The whole scene is quickly shown to be a parody, but of what exactly, it is hard to say. Ostensibly we could see this as a science-fiction drug novel, like a pastiche of Ron Goulart and Hunter S. Thompson. But the language is so consistently broken, the reader has to be a lover of puns and hyperbolic nonsense to really appreciate it. Walter doesn’t sleep off his dose, he “cools on his slab until roostertime.” He doesn’t walk downstairs to the street, but “ankles hellwards,” or something like that, the verbs always getting switched up like knuckleballs that begin to seem more and more like a series of wild pitches. Another hitch to this novel is that the drug lingo is so exaggerated and absurd. When Walter is interrogated by a pair of beautiful yet strange women who have picked him up at a live music venue, he tries to explain his constant use of drugs: “Business class tickets out of bittersville. Mind masters only, got a cold war going on with the body breakers. Can’t stand cokey joes, speedsters, redheads…“ So which drugs does he take? “Psychedelics. LSD-25, 34, 65. Mescaline and or peyote, fly agaric, ergine, ibogaine, yage, psilocibin derivative and the natural state, virola, so forth and so on.“ The inclusion of ibogaine, of course, is a great touch! The drug that Muskie was supposedly getting from a mysterious Brazilian doctor during the 1972 Presidential election campaign. Once that baby turned up, I was onto the beat of Womack’s strange thread! It is a slipstream fantasy story. Because Hunter S. Thompson made up that rumor about ibogaine in the first place, but it was three or four years after the setting of Womack’s story. Increasingly as the tale continues, the timeline begins to get stretched or warped in ways that make no sense. Events of the late 1950s or the mid-1970s are mixed and matched into the story, artfully enough, so that when the assassination of the President is described &#8212; in _Going Going Gone_ it is Richard Nixon (not J.F.K) who gets shot &#8212; the tapestry of events is fully revealed as a completely crazy quilt. They are not in Dallas, but New Orleans. They are not riding in a Lincoln limosine, but in a Pierce Arrow. “Ka-chow! sneezes the roscoe. Before the Trickster feels that warm gulf breeze where the top of his head used to be he finds himself heading way down south, getting the purple-ass treatment from Satan’s snickering imps.“ Eventually even the purple prose (looks cool in black-light!) begins to have an addictive flavor to it. When some seriously weird things begin to happen, the chemically altered states of consciousness that Womack has been kicking around like an old soccer ball finally gel into captivating imagery. &#160;The way in which the paint peels off the houses and floats up into the sky during the climax of the book is rather interestingly done…and it doesn’t matter if it came straight out of a Hollywood flick. Surprisingly enough, after world-hopping and dimensions of space-time melting, the ending of the book is almost satisfying. This despite the plot holes, (so big you could drive a galaxy through them,) and the often meandering blobbergosh that the narrator is laying on us. As the action proceeds, Womack falls into a more standard prose style, so that the last fifth of the book is written in an almost &#8216;normal’ voice. But hang onto your paisley bell-bottoms, brothers! If you read Going Going Gone you will have to ride the whirlwind with a monkey on your back, and if you pass the acid test, the only thing you will gain is to know how fast you can macheté your way through jungles of finger-snapping lunacy. &#160;Which is a pink and peppermint sort of trip, if you can dig it! &nbsp; &nbsp;","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"drugs","slug":"drugs","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/drugs/"},{"name":"aliens","slug":"aliens","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/aliens/"},{"name":"book review","slug":"book-review","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/book-review/"}]},{"title":"Finding your way around Mars...","slug":"finding-your-way-around-mars","date":"2014-07-22T20:27:38.000Z","updated":"2017-10-24T03:02:34.000Z","comments":true,"path":"COSMOS/finding-your-way-around-mars/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/COSMOS/finding-your-way-around-mars/","excerpt":"","text":"Pretty soon we will be able to know the solar system like the back of our hand.

It is like a film noir, set in a mythical Eastern European city &#8212; I’m convinced it is partly based on Prague &#8212; where populations living in mutually incompatible paradlgms “unsee“ each other. The beauty of this idea is that, (quite beyond the metaphor,) it could be almost any *real* city; with populations that are utterly invisible to one another. Old and young, rich and poor, leftist and fascist, black and white: there are, in fact, far too many axes of unseeing in our everyday lives… Miéville artfully teases out our curiosity and angst about how the *other half* live by embeddlng us in a murder mystery and then unravelllng the social and “grosstopical” threads that are interwoven across the two cities of the narrative. Bes?el and Ul Qoma. The East European, Turkic, and Middle Eastern vibe of Miéville’s language is round, chewy, earthy; like loaves of hard black bread. The protagonist, Tyador Borlú comes to life primarily as a center of awareness by the way in which he is framed within the city-scape, by what he “unthinks” rather than what he thinks. It is rare to read a new novel that works well on so many levels. I certainly have to congratulate China Miéville on this book: he is firing on all cylinders! What you have, in The City and the City, if you are willing to find it…is a science fiction novel that degausses itself into a paranoid fantasy; a mystery that unravels itself into a delusion; a psycho-geography that deconstructs itself into blueprints. The pyscho-geography of these intertwined cities reminds me of the &#8216;psychetecture’ of Radiant City, where the main architect, Mister X, has become a sleepless madman, striving to correct the flaws of his own design. In Miéville’s Siamese-twin cities, our hero Borlú is pitted against not only a murderer and other unseen adversaries, but also against the very fabric of the built environment &#8212; made all the more diabolical because the actual process of “unseeing” the people, vehicles, and buildings all around him is a product of psychological conditioning more than anything else. As Borlú makes his way from one city perspective to another, his mental state becomes a reflection on the difference between his perceived point of view and his expected, socially conditioned point of view. At the same time he is always aware of an almost supernatural vagueness &#8212; the Breach &#8212; that asserts itself menacingly in between both viewpoints, and maintains a draconian enforcement over their separateness of being. Despite this treacherously indeterminate landscape, Miéville manages to keep the story alive, and keeps us focused on the handful of characters as they navigate through seen and unseen streets. Sliding in the background of each scene, eliding each other in the semi-darkness of a foggy night, the false facades of the two cities are like stage props &#8212; think J. G. Ballard’s “Screen Game” in _Vermillion Sands_ &#8212; and the city (or the two cities, or is it the three…or _four…_cities!) all finally get resolved into a psychological projection onto three dimensional space. Perhaps it is a false perception to think that there is more than a single city. Are we just playing mind games on ourselves, dividing our allegiance to shared space, and going so far as to actually live in compartmentalized ideologies? The irony, of course, is that Borlú keeps getting recruited to defend exactly the opposite of what he believes. It is not that he has switched sides, but that he has been absorbed into a deeper level of the looking glass. And like Alice, he can only nibble on the mushrooms and carry on!","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"mystery","slug":"mystery","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/mystery/"},{"name":"propaganda","slug":"propaganda","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/propaganda/"}]},{"title":"Unboxing a 1964 Smith Corona Sterling","slug":"unboxing-a-1964-smith-corona-sterling","date":"2013-08-03T07:21:31.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"MACHINES/unboxing-a-1964-smith-corona-sterling/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/MACHINES/unboxing-a-1964-smith-corona-sterling/","excerpt":"It would be great if everyone was as lucky as I was today when unboxing a Fedex carton containing a used manual typewriter. &#160; The typical horror stories of rattling loose pieces and totally broken machines could be greatly reduced in number if people were careful packers, like the “secretagent” who sold me this beautiful old typer!","text":"It would be great if everyone was as lucky as I was today when unboxing a Fedex carton containing a used manual typewriter. &#160; The typical horror stories of rattling loose pieces and totally broken machines could be greatly reduced in number if people were careful packers, like the “secretagent” who sold me this beautiful old typer! For some reason, I was bitten by an overpowering urge to migrate some of my typing from the laptop keyboard &#8212; with it’s seductive bright screen blazing away in front of my face all day long &#8212; to a nice, standard old non-electric typewriter. Sure, it would be nice if I could just replace the wonderful old Royal Quiet Deluxe - Aristocrat, that I typed on like an absolute maniac from 1978 to 1993. &#160; I have never counted up the pages and calculated the raw word count…but let’s just say between half a million and a million words were banged out on that fantastic old glass-keyed Royal. &#160; But then, having been beaten on so long, the main gear in the escapement had it’s teeth worn off, and one of them even cracked. &#160; I tried valiantly to braze the gear back together, and managed to reassemble the Royal afterwards &#8212; a small miracle all by itself &#8212; but it never had it’s old snappy attitude, and I was always afraid to punch the keys too hard after that. &#160;The Royal now sits, in retirement, in a closet at my Dad’s place, sadly reduced from a fascist-killing machine to a sweet old curiosity. So I hit ebay and several blogs of retro typewriter fanatics who have a lot of info on those machines of loving grace. &#160;I started to think highly of the Olivetti Lettera models and Olympia SF, and flirted around with the idea of an old Hermes Rocket, or even some crazy stuff like the Robotron Cella, Adler Tippa S, and other exotic plastic 1970s junk. &#160; Last weekend I went to look at a Lettera 32 that someone listed on Craigslist for $100. &#160; Sure, I could get one on ebay for $50 - $60 plus shipping, but after the horror stories about people bringing in boxes of busted, rattling gears and carriages from the guys at Cambridge typewriter, I thought it might be worth checking out a machine in vivo, and see how the thing felt. Strange to say, despite all the raves about Lettera typers, I just felt the keys were sort of mushy and light. &#160;They hit the paper in a half-certain way, leaving fuzzy marks and shadows around the typeface. &#160; I realized that the slickness factor just didn’t stack up for me. &#160;I wanted something as solid as the Royal, if not as perfect in every way. &#160;I wanted a machine with a respectable punch and that was known to stand up to continuous typing for long periods of time. &#160; Based on further research, it really seemed like only an Olympia SM3, a Smith Corona Sterling or Super Silent, or another 1940s Royal was going to work. In the end, I found a listing for a claimed “mint condition” Sterling. &#160; The photos sure looked good. &#160;And the seller agreed good-naturedly to pack the keys down with paper and wrap the whole kit in lots of bubble wrap. &#160;Sounded like it was worth a try. &#160; &#160;And, his packing really was near perfect! &nbsp; Sure, I was delighted to see that the main mechanisms were in near-mint condition and the machine was all in one piece! &#160; However, I was concerned by the way the lower edge of the shell was abutting the space bar… &#160; Before bidding, I made sure to ask if all the keys struck and space bar worked normally. &#160;I was assured that they did. &#160; But that turned out not to be the case. Even so, after getting the Sterling home from my office, I took a careful look around at the fit of the shell and just decided to use some pliers to bend the shell away from the space bar by a mm or so. &#160; And, bang! &#160;that did the trick! &#160; Now the typer really does work like a charm, and all the other functionality is fine. Here’s a bit of typecast from the first page of typing (and using the ribbon it came with!) After getting some ink on paper, I tossed it on the Nanoscan and saved it to PDF. &#160; After a little searching I found a free community version of PDF OCR X that works on the MAC, and in a few seconds I’d gone from pounding on the right respectable Sterling typer to a text file in digital land. A nice outcome all around! &nbsp;","categories":[{"name":"MACHINES","slug":"MACHINES","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/MACHINES/"}],"tags":[{"name":"gadgets","slug":"gadgets","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/gadgets/"},{"name":"typewriters","slug":"typewriters","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/typewriters/"}]},{"title":"Readercon 24, Where did we go from here?","slug":"readercon-24-where-did-we-go-from-here","date":"2013-07-15T04:44:40.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"IDEAS/readercon-24-where-did-we-go-from-here/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/IDEAS/readercon-24-where-did-we-go-from-here/","excerpt":"Last year at Readercon, there was an emotional dust-up over a sordid harassment incident, in addition to a scary and unexpected medical emergency for one of our favorite editors.

Writing Others: Theory&#160; &#160; &#160;The session was not on how to write about aliens from outer space as others, but the more nuanced socio-cultural others of our human society, such as getting into the heads of people not of the same race, same gender, sexual orientation, or social demographic group as ourselves. &#160; &#160;Andrea Hairston looked at this from the perspective of the theatre and acting, in which there is a journey from the self to the other, or a conjuring of “other” characters from within. &#160; She mentioned that in her book, _Mindscape_, the characters were explicitly written to be contained within the spheres of their own world views, and that the interaction of these spheres was at the core of the novel. &#160; But some readers complained, she said, that her character Luanda, a black woman physicist, talked in a sort of black English, that they didn’t find to be credible. &#160; Later she tried to tone down the black English. “Not that I’m trying to sell millions of books,” Hairston said, “but I would like a few readers.” Sabrina Vourvoulias wondered “Why are we writing to a default white audience?” “If we are going to get away from that default white setting,” Rose Lemberg said, “then have to figure out how intersectional characters - of mixed, multi-level backgrounds, races, genders personalities - can appeal to our readers. &#160; For example, can aliens based on non-human biology be the only gender-neutral characters that we refer to with non-binary (male-female) pronouns? &#160; We will need to de-colonize our perspectives, even from historical contexts, to get to this point of complex intersectional others.” Joan Slonczewski added, “My French Muslim math genius also got heavily criticized as being somehow out of sync with the normal French cultural context. &#160; So you are damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” The panel spent some time discussing the use or the avoidance of foreign languages in their English language stories, the general conclusion of which seemed to be that using phrases and terms in other languages as a way of developing otherness in a character can offer multiple levels of connection with the reader, but has to be used in a way that is authentic to a native speaker of the language in question. &#160; &#160; Hairston: &#160;”Sometimes when a character speaks in German, it is because what he’s saying can only be properly said and clearly understood in German” But&#160;Daniel José Older added a caution.&#160; Some words must definitely NOT be set apart in italics to emphasize their otherness, if in fact they are deeply embedded in a multilingual culture. &#160; “You can’t italicize a natively used term regardless of the original language, for example “I went to the supermercado,” because it is not actually being said in a foreign language.” What the Future Is, and What the Future Is Not &#160; This panel rambled vaguely around futurist issues, such as the degree to which human gestures or brain waves will be able to connect directly with electronic devices. &#160; John Shirley mentioned his book, _Song Called Youth_, in which performers &#8212; connected by wires to audio synthesizers &#8212; used their entire bodies as musical instruments. &#160; He said that when he edited the book for a new edition he converted the wires to wireless connections to try to keep up with the times. John Crowley mentioned a pamphlet that he discovered on the “Future of Theatre,” which predicted a stage framed by large abstract colored projections controlled by the movements of actors or dancers. &#160; &#160;At the end of this imaginary “future” performance, the audience was then led out past a series of booths set up by various charities, and the premise was that the entire show was designed to soothe the audience and manipulate their mood so that they would be moved to make donations. The conversation then, predictably enough, turned to robots. &#160;”How long until machines can say, “I,” Crowley wondered. &#160; &#160;”Well if you call a major corporation today you will get a robotic voice asking &#160;how can I help you, so the machine self-referenced I already exists,” Shirley replied. &#160;”There is not sentience there, so I guess the upside is that you can be abusive and swear at them when they bother you with a bunch of useless information you don’t need.” Bud Sparkhawk pointed out: &#160;”the future of robots will not result in a huge clanking, anthropomorphic machine that mimics our own actions. &#160;Rather it will manifest itself in ubiquitous automation of countless devices all around us, each with a specific function, and these will respond to human or semi-automated commands triggered by RFIDs or chips that we carry with us, possibly even chips implanted in our bodies. &#160; We will be interacting with all these devices 24/7.” Glenn Grant turned the discussion to machines “replacing” humans in various tasks, in overly optimistic terms; a position that John Shirley questioned, wondering if automatons might eventually replace &#8212; and simultaneously devalue! &#8212; human labor. &#160; &#160;Grant admitted that recent history has already shown that American society is not up to dealing with such high levels of disruption &#8212; the off-shoring of countless manufacturing jobs &#8212; in a way that has acceptable consequences to the displaced workers. John Crowley mentioned that one outcome of the disparity of wealth and lack of jobs has been the emergence of small scale artisanal businesses, like vineyards in Vermont, or speciality vegetables grown in local greenhouses. &#160; He expressed hope that if a truly dismal collapse of civilization occurs that those crafts and trades being revived by the local artisans, gardeners, and DIY advocates would be able to transfer to the displaced masses. &#160; “But when you get down to it,” Crowley said, “there is no such thing as the future. &#160; &#160;Our forecasting just creates parables (either good or bad) that try to reset the terms of where we are heading.” There was some discussion of global climate change and it’s possible effects &#8212; pocket utopias for the elites, and great swathes of humanity living on the edge of survival or extinction. &#160;Shirley said there is always the risk of an Orwellian future, but that is why people need to push back. For some reason this discussion was completely inadequate for one audience member, who identified himself as a Silicon Valley engineer. &#160; He said that, as an engineer, working in the context of corporations and laboratories, he sees the future being built every day. &#160;A future of devices, such as smartphones, such as video call-enabled televisions, and a host of other biometric or human-sensory augmenting devices. &#160; In the questioner’s opinion, both the panelists, and the larger sphere of science fiction writers were ignoring this looming future and not dealing with it in their works. &#160; In addition, he said that there is no question of an Orwellian future, because we are living in a surveillance state today where everything we say, write or do will be recorded, and the only question is who will have access to the recordings. The panelists began to disagree, but before I could clearly make out what their positions were, the audience member angrily told them that “you people don’t know anything about the future!” and stormed out of the room. &#160; “I guess we’ll see you, in the future,” &#160;Crowley said. On the subject of how those new technologies get embedded into the context of the present day reality, Bud Sparhawk made an analogy: &#160;”When motion pictures came out, why did they put the projectors in the back of the audience? &#160;Because movies were first overlaying, then displacing the theatre and the vaudeville stage, and those projectors merely were set up where the spotlights had been. &#160; Similarly, why should the motor be in the front of the car? &#160; Because that is where the horse used to be!”&#160;&#160; Sparhawks’ comment struck me as quite important. Regarding the outraged engineer’s comment &#8212; although I disagreed with both his auto-didactic point of view and behavior &#8212; I certainly do agree with his basic premise:&#160; that we are currently living in a surveillance state. &#160; But it seems to me, taking Sparhawk’s observation into account, that the acceleration and invasion of digital spying into all facets of our lives is merely another overlay of a new technology onto an existing function. &#160; That function is the tendency of the security apparatus of our government, (well, no doubt ANY government,) to become paranoid and to seek all possible means to identify and eliminate dissent. It doesn’t really matter if the media being spied upon are handwritten notes, or audio recordings, or digital indices, the pernicious aspect of the panopticon surveillance state is that some of our fellow citizens feel justified in spying on all the rest of us. &#160; &#160;In their paranoid delusion, our society is safer collectively when a secret army of analysts infiltrate and destroy the privacy of the entire population on an individual basis, weeding out anyone that they suspect.&#160; &#160;Indeed, it is that delusion, that ideology, that we must defeat! For starters, we might look at the origins of the American surveillance state, and then figure out how sfnal futures can help us to shut it down forever.&#160;&#160;&#160; Why not accept John Crowley’s wisdom, and set up our own parables to reset the rules of the game?&#160;&#160; Storming out of the conversation is not going to solve anything, that much is obvious.","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"futurism","slug":"futurism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/futurism/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"tyranny","slug":"tyranny","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/tyranny/"}]},{"title":"Down and Out in Paris and London, Ch. 22","slug":"down-and-out-in-paris-and-london-chapter-22","date":"2013-07-08T01:37:14.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"PODCASTS/down-and-out-in-paris-and-london-chapter-22/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/PODCASTS/down-and-out-in-paris-and-london-chapter-22/","excerpt":"","text":"Most of George Orwell’s classic, Down and Out in Paris and London, is a first person account of near-starvation and slaving away as a dishwasher in the bowels of a French hotel. &#160; But there is one section, Chapter 22, which raises the issue of poverty and useless toil to a philosophical level. Judging from my own useless toil in the sink at the Village Inn, among other venues, I can say the Orwell has certainly framed the problem well, and that not much has changed. &#160; Men and women everywhere must scrub and slave away like serfs, while a disinterested class of wealthier individuals sniff at their plates of nouveau-drizzled crocquettes. &#160; Personally, I do not believe we can eliminate toil from human society, just as much as we are incapable of eliminating the parasitic class. &#160;But I do believe that we could do a better job of spreading the wealth and spreading the burden…what we don’t want is the often-repeated model of raising the standard of living of one class, while pushing the burakumin, untouchable tasks onto some other less fortunate human beings. Isn’t it time for human society &#8212; at long last! &#8212; to develop sustainable methods and technologies for our basic needs, and to stop pouring the wealth of nations into bottomless pits of weapons, “intelligence,” &#160;”security,” and allowing a tiny minority of sociopaths, the King greedheads of the 1%, to suck up all remaining treasure? &#160; Can’t we just try? By the way, the French quote from Villon (no doubt unintelligible as I have pronounced it) is from the poem La Testament: Et pain ne voient qu’aux fenestres which I think means something like “(those who) see bread only through shop windows.” &#160; &#160;Which brings to mind the lyric of Bertolt Brecht: &#160;”Make sure those who are now starving, get proper helpings when we all start carving.” &#160; &#160;Sadly, the American society where I live is more insanely obsessed with sporting events and driving their cars in pointless circles, then they are in seeing the simple virtue of making sure that their fellows are not driven by hunger into serfdom. &#160; &#160;Let’s fix that!

Tracing the utopian, socialist, and totalitarian themes in Russian fantastika literature from it’s earliest origins in the late 18th Century, the author describes how various Russian writers reacted to events such as the failed revolution in 1905, and the victory of the communists in 1917. For every utopian vision of the early Russian SF, there were dystopias, horrors, and complexities. Zamaytin’s _We_, published in 1921, is considered the classic tale of dystopia under totalitarianism, but according to Potts, it was not a counter-revolutionary work so much as a complaint that the Bolshevik utopia had not gone far enough towards the total liberation and union of personal and political interests. The modernist craze of the Leninist years eventually was constricted by Stalin’s paranoia, resulting in a number of science fiction authors vanishing to the gulags.

When the “thaw” finally took place in 1956, the subsequent launch of Sputnik propelled Soviet SF into a new hard science phase that eventually was characterized as “cold stream” SF. This cold stream was one in which SF was narrowly conceived of as optimistic, science-oriented, and upbeat; similar to our sense-of-wonder space opera days, but one emerging from the constraints of Stalinist censorship and therefore self-consciously regulating itself and focused on a sort of vanguard of hard science futurism. The Strugatsky brothers, whose themes were more diffuse, more challenging, and informed by anthropology, psychology and the “soft” sciences, as well as the nascent New Wave, were seen as “warm stream” writers.

Brandis, V. Dmitrevsky, “In the Land of SF,” Soviet Literature (no. 5, 1968): 148) This strikes me as just a brilliant way to write anything! After reading this I discovered a complete Russian translation of Potts’ book, which was the only place I could confirm the original Russian for cold stream &#1093;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1076;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; &#1087;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1082;&#1072; and warm stream &#1090;&#1077;&#1087;&#1083;&#1099;&#1084; &#1087;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1084;. How uplifting a thought! To write fiction to inspire others with lofty ideals… And why not also cook foods to promote health and happiness? This positive energy is truly needed! Especially in the today’s world, where the debate rages on the “value” or “artistic motives” behind the depiction of torture in the movie Zero Dark Thirty. For my part, I agree with Slavoj Zizek, which is to say that we should know in our guts that torture is wrong and be repelled by it…that the “nuetral” depiction of it in arts is merely a method of desensitizing humanity and making it more subject to such atrocities, particularly when the story is about the way in which torturers compartmentalize their actions and appear to be members of “normal” society. There is nothing normal or acceptable about a torturer, a sociopath, or a serial killer! Such people need to be stopped before they do more harm! But we live in an age when torturers are protected and their accusers jailed. Which is a sad thing. Further, we live in an age when people make dessert cakes in the shape of severed human body parts, with pieces of bone sticking out, tied up with edible ropes and shackles, and lying in pools of red frosting “blood.” This sort of hideous psychotic cake is considered “amusing” and an “art form” by people at BoingBoing. I am so sickened by this cynical attitude that I have suddenly realized how poisonous BoingBoing itself is. The &#252;ber-geeks, who portray themselves as the “smartest guys in the room… even smarter than those other guys!” are, in point of fact, unthinking, uncritical, and undeveloped spiritually. They are riding on a collossal wave of popularity, but they are shallow, cynical, and &#8212; if you look at the sort of gruesome shit that turns them on &#8212; somewhat depraved, in my opinion. And guess what, if they feel entitled to shit all over anyone who doesn’t agree with their opinion about “art,” (which they certainly do with great gusto and self-satisfied crowing in their blog posts and comments,) then I am certainly entitled to have my opinion about their behavior! Therefore, I have resolved to totally shut off my contact with that “trendy” BoingBoing bullshit. Previously I thought the contributors kept up with current affairs in a healthy fashion, for example, by widely disseminating the tragic death of Aaron Swartz. But now my opinion has drastically changed. By playing favorites and shooting from the hip without any moral compass, the sum effect of BoingBoing is negative, and just serves to perpetuate the fascist bullshit that it pretends to oppose. Think of the mixed message: Boingboing exhibits moral outrage about the prosecution of Aaron Swartz, and then exactly the same level of outrage at someone who comments that “edible body parts” photos are disgusting. Are these “crimes” comparable? Ultimately it serves exactly the same purpose as Zero Dark Thirty, which is to inoculate a large audience with the impression that extreme violence is “okay” and “normal” under certain circumstances. You can torture another living being because you are fighting for the “good side;” and you can gobble down severed human body parts because they are just “amusing” desserts; you can watch the extreme graphic gore in Django Unchained that makes you vomit and still love the movie because it just so “great.” What the hell is wrong with the brains of people being subjected to this continuous onslaught of graphic slaughter? To be perfectly clear: they have been brainwashed into thinking destruction of living beings is cool and fun to watch. Evil? Psychotic? Yes, in point of fact. And just saying… if that stuff turns you on, then you are disturbed. I’m not going to argue with anyone about this. On the contrary, I am going to think long and hard about the passage on “warm stream” SF quoted above… That is the message! Not brutality, but raising of consciousness! Thank goodness for the dialectic that resulted in Russian critics actually reflecting on these matters. If only aggressive morons with blood running down their demented chins will not kill the rest of us, we can still do good work for humanity and for the great spirit that permeates the cosmos. I know exactly whose side I’m on, brother! And it is not the giggling, posturing jack-asses who are sinking their teeth into chunks of cakes in the shape of human body parts.","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"social mores","slug":"social-mores","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/social-mores/"}]},{"title":"Jung on Freud","slug":"jung-on-freud","date":"2013-01-18T08:59:50.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"PODCASTS/jung-on-freud/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/PODCASTS/jung-on-freud/","excerpt":"","text":"&nbsp; I’ve always been fascinated by the relationship between Jung and Freud, especially from the perspective of Jung, as related in Memories, Dreams, Reflections. &#160;There are certainly plenty of outsider opinions: &#160; ranging from the breezy website where I found this odd photo of the two men on safari in sub-Saharan Africa, to the mystical musings of Miguel Serrano in The Hermetic Circle.

There are more than a few sociological parallels to the cult that figures in the book I just finished, _Imaginary Friends_ (1967), by Alison Lurie. In this very straightforward story, we are brought into the small upstate New York town of Sophis, where two researchers from the University have embedded themselves into a “flying saucer cult.”&#160; The young Associate Professor, fresh out of Columbia University, acts as the narrator, assisting the gruff senior Professor on his study of group dynamics among cult members.&#160; While the researchers take notes about the body language and interactions of the group, the cult members carry on in their belief that beings of light are descending to Earth from the planet Varna, and are whipped into frenzies of anticipation by the over-ripe teenager, Verena, who falls into trances and produces automatic writing messages from their alien contact, Ro of Varna.&#160; While the story advances in slow, methodical fashion, it occasionally hits on deeper truths: “Apparently, although people like to hear that they and the Universe are good and getting better all the time, they like even more to be told that they are wicked sinners in a dark pit, and can only be saved through great effort, the repetition of magic formulae, and the aid of invisible beings.” As the researchers get more deeply involved with the highly anticipated Coming of the aliens, the narrator begins to question his motivations, and finds himself taking on the persona of the cult to such an extent that he questions his own sanity.&#160; The principal investigator, on the other hand, is completely self-assured about the purpose of the research.&#160; No matter what tactic he takes to keep the ball rolling, no matter how enmeshed in the whole cult philosophy he gets, he never questions his own mental state. Don’t these two characters reflect most of us in America today?&#160;&#160; Either numbed into shell-shock by the total insanity that has been foisted on us as “terror,” which was basically a lie; or blindly waving flags to “support our troops” with pit-bull belligerence. We were forced to watch our government create offshore concentration camps, and told to look the other way as agents put black bags over peoples heads then renditioned them away to be tortured…all as if things were “under control.”&#160;&#160; Of course, it turns out that what they actually were planning was martial law, absolute fascism, the Gestapo, to bring the gloved fist of the secret government out into the open and to smash anyone who dared to complain.&#160;&#160; During this time the media simply repeated every line of bogus bullshit that came out of the White House, slavishly drinking the kool-aid like the lap dogs they really are. Most of us are left to question our own sanity.&#160;&#160; Can this total delusion be real? Can people actually live with themselves when the cognitive dissonance of our so-called leader class is diametrically opposed to the reality we can see with our own eyes?&#160; And yet, there are some, apparently, who feel completely confident and assured that what they are doing is right - even as they are marching straight into the ovens!

He grew up around Indiana, Pennsylvania where his father, Thomas Gower Gault, was a Professor, and also served as Chair of the Geography Department at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Ditch Gault was a true rennaissance man, surrounded by books, and he was an eternal student, having racked up college courses on every subject in the humanities for more than a decade without ever having earned a degree in any subject. In the 60s he was an enthusiastic member of the counter-culture at the University, and became obsessed with politics. He spent many years amassing information on the Kennedy assassination, which he documented in an article called _The CIA’s big rub-out_, published in July 1975. But politics were only one of Ditch’s many interests, which ranged from history to philosophy to mysticism and the occult. Although he was a polymath, and an eclectic seeker of knowledge in many forms, he never limited his sources of information to any particular media or genre. He was just as interested in comic books and UFOs, as in more traditional forms of literary theory, psychology, and “hard” sciences. For Ditch Gault, it was the ideas that mattered, not the vector from which they arrived. In the summer of 1976, Ditch Gault took a course on Literary Analysis, which is where he met his future wife, Karen Price. At that time, Karen was a sophomore and Ditch was a thirty-year-old eternal student, who continuously challenged and heckled the Professor from the back row of the classroom. Another student in the class was Susan Johnston Graf, who later went on to earn a PhD at University of Kansas. The three became close friends. In those days, Ditch could be frequently found in the student union, where he “held court” and discussed everything from religion to occult magic. Also around this time, Karen began to assist Ditch in typing up some of his papers and longer works, which included essays, bibliographies, and longer works of fiction. Although he was interested in religious subjects, in mysticism, and in esoteric knowledge of all kinds, Ditch Gault was never satisfied with any particular form of organized religion. He read widely on the religions of the world, on Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam, and was especially attracted to Sufism. Ultimately, Ditch did not label himself or subscribe to any traditional religious practice. Instead he simply studied all forms of religious experience, dabbled in occult magic, and made a rigorous study of the Tarot. Ditch typically used the _Rider-Waite Tarot Deck_ in the traditional Celtic Cross spread, and would frequently read cards for friends. He also taught a class to a group of friends on the history and reading methods of the Tarot. Eventually these studies resulted in a series of essays and web pages on the Tarot, one of which was Ditch’s original method on how to use Tarot cards to read the I-Ching. To make a living, Ditch Gault managed used book stores, book search services, comic book stores, and also wrote, although he never expected to make any money from writing. He had a modest source of income from a trust, which he received as an inheritance from his grandmother. It wasn’t much, but it gave him the leisure and freedom to be able to deal used books and comics and spend most of his time on his writing, reading, and research. He had quite a few correspondents, including people at the Alfred Machen society in London (active during the 1980s-90s), Brian Taves at the Library of Congress, and many others. Ditch became interested in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn when he was studying the life of the magician-poet, Yeats. Although he was quite familiar with the works of Aleister Crowley, Ditch was more drawn to the naturalism of Yeats. He was also an advisor, perhaps gadfly, to his colleague Susan Johnston Graf, as she worked on her book _W.B. Yeats Twentieth Century Magus_. Ditch’s review of the book can still be found on Amazon. For his own website, Order of the Twilight Star, Ditch collected a gallery of photographs of the Order of the Golden Dawn members, and wrote concise captions for them. As he amassed all of this information on Arthur Machen, the Tarot, Talbot Mundy, esoteric literature, UFOs, mysticism, etc, Ditch began to develop a master list in the form of a bibliography. Ditch explained this project to Karen Price, saying that he noticed trends in the early to mid-60s, and that these trends were starting to re-occur. Based on his analysis, Ditch compiled Absolute Elsewhere purely for himself to keep track of the trends and connections that he perceived in the occult, fringe, and visionary literature of his time. At first it was just a straight list of references, but later he began to include commentary about the sources, and to add images of the covers. In the end, Absolute Elsewhere provides both a chronological trail of mystical ideas, as well as a visual story of how those ideas appeared to the reader as they might have encountered them on book covers, movie posters, or other media between 1945 - 1979. Karen Price, who was married to Ditch Gault at the time of his passing, still has all of his books and papers, including several novels in manuscript that were never published. One of these is called “Terraplane Woman,” and is set in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Another novel, “Cycle 21,” is set in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where epic floods occurred in the late 19th Century, and where early sightings of the so-called Mothman took place, (later the center of a supernatural scare best known by the book, the “Mothman Prophecies.”) “With Absolute Elsewhere Ditch was working through ideas and seeing how they intersected.” said Price. “He did it for himself as a way to make sense out of the world. And he just liked fringe.” Many thanks to Karen Price, for introducing us to the creator of “Ditch’s Puzzle Palace,” “Order of the the Twilight Star” and “Absolute Elsewhere.” A few links to R.T.

The original Batman, as portrayed in the late 30s and early 40s by Bob Kane, was straight out of the pulp-avenger style. He wouldn’t think twice about killing his enemies or beating them to a pulp. It was only the “shiny happy” policy of DC comics that scrubbed him into a clean, ethical do-gooder during the 50s and early 60s. The renascence of Batman as a grim, internally conflicted, and merciless vigilante occurred several times, including a stint in the 60s under the hands of Denny O’Neill and Neal Adams, and more famously in the 80s Dark Knight series by Frank Miller. The entire current raft of Batman films sprang from Tim Burton’s adaption of the Dark Knight, and has been thrashing vapidly around on the screen like a shark trying to jump itself ever since. In any case, the point is that this Batman, the Dark Knight, is supposedly a portrayal of Bruce Wayne’s internal struggle to be noble and good, and at the same time to sacrifice his image to public opinion in order to fight the bad guys. There are a series of overt references in the current film about Batman’s need to do whatever has to be done in order to fight the total insanity of terrorism. Is it just me, or are there other concurrent examples of this self-justification? Examples which, in the name of fighting terrorism, the supposed good-guys commit acts of mayhem and destruction and even try to justify the use of human torture… In short, do we really need this sort of sickening apologia in a bloody Batman movie, or is it just par for the course? Of course nobody even bothers to notice this fact embedded in the film, even though it weighs the entire story down like the Rock of Gibraltar on top of Batman’s emotionless head. You know, when it comes to the original Batman by Bob Kane, he was just slugging it out with some scumbags and breaking their necks every now and then. He wasn’t buddy buddy with the police commissioner in those days, he was considered a criminal and thug. Only after three decades of smiley-face sanitizing by the editors of D.C. comics did the Batman &amp; Gordon fighting for the good of Gotham City come about; but in our current episode we now have the conflated mess of not only the original outlaw Batman, but also his square-jawed do-gooder personality, and his various fascistic Dark Knight outbursts, along with his mood-swings of self doubt. The fact that this complicated persona is portrayed by Christian Bale with all the panache of a corpse slowly entering rigor mortis does not help to unwind the tangle. Indeed there are only two humane acts that take place in the entire film, neither of them by Batman. First, and foremost, when the hardened criminal says: “I’m going to do what you should have done ten minutes ago,” and hurls the detonator out of the ship’s window, he proves not only that he is not a monster and is able to think clearly about the meaning of human life, but also that he is brave enough to act on it, unlike everyone else around him. Even though he is shackled in handcuffs, he still does the right thing. This by the way, is supposed to somehow contrast the middle class fool on the other ship, who has convinced himself that his own ulcer and mortgage are more important than hundreds of other human lives and yet, when he picks up the detonator key, he is too much of a chickenshit to act on his own convictions. This is some kind of ethics? Which forces us to be utterly sympathetic to the Joker, when he sees that the midnight hour has arrived without either ship having been destroyed, and laments: “must I do everything myself?” But herein lies the basic conflict of the two characters &#8212; Batman thinks that the acts of the people on the ships, who choose not to blow up the other ship, is evidence of the humanity that still prevails in Gotham City, while the Joker merely considers the result to be a fluke, since the result could have gone one way or another. The truth seems to be rather more on the Joker’s side considering that only the insubordination of a prisoner, the lack of resolution of those in charge, combined with an overwhelmingly selfish and callous public who were in the end spineless to carry out their own majority decision is what saved the day. Hooray for the righteousness of the pathetic and beaten down sheep! It is driven home, again and again, that it is not the Batman who has been reading his Nietzsche, but the Joker. The second humane act of the film is committed by the butler Arthur, when he burns the good-bye letter from Rachel. This is supposedly some sort of sacrifice of the truth to save Bruce Wayne from torment. We presume that Arthur is motivated to do this so that Wayne will carry on with his fascist mission of self-righteous bullshit, and not be distracted by the sad but unnecessary fact that Rachel dumped his violent pathologies in favor of the rich lawyer. When it comes to the rich lawyer himself, we are treated to his simultaneous moral and physical devolution into savagery. Perhaps we might have suspected this could happen, since he deliberately kidnapped a paranoid schizophrenic in order to torture him with his own hands, only to be supposedly saved on the precipice by Batman. How is it that Batman appears at his shoulder, like Jiminy Cricket, at that critical moment for the lawyer Dent, but cannot somehow provide the same service for himself? Nonetheless, when Dent realizes that half of his face is burnt off into a hideous CGI graphic (guaranteed to give your children ten years of nightmares and a xanax addiction), and then writhes against his bonds when the Joker visits his hospital bed, he rather easily turns over to the dark side. In this case we can only conclude that Pavlov and Skinner were right, society is to blame for everything! Unlike the kharma that Jeanne Moreau suffers at the end of Vadim’s _Les Liasons Dangerouses_, Dent is not scarred as a consequence of his actions, his scars become the catalyst of his actions. Look what society did to me! Look! Now I am above your stupid laws! This message is the subliminal beat-down that viewers of this movie must endure. The very same message is repeated in the various “explanations” that the Joker gives for his scarred face. Always the victim of nasty sadistic acts, the Joker has clearly gone over a different boundary into pure insanity. Ledger’s Joker is spectacular. His tics, his posture, his sheer enjoyment of total chaos, is a tour-de-force achievement, which plunges me into both despair and sadness. Despair, because, when compared with the milquetoast macho idiot, Batman, there is no question that the Joker’s persona will become totemic for an entire new generation of lost youth. This is something worthy of despair, and yet Hollywood, with is cynical greed, will continue to churn out zombies, slashers, maniacs galore, and even give mountains of cash to utterly talentless hacks like M Night Shyamalan on the mere chance that he can put a chill up the spine of some people who think that his snail-paced nausea is scary. Shyamalan’s works are certainly a nightmare of mediocrity, but let us get back to the sadness of Ledger’s Joker. The sadness, the deep sadness, I feel while watching this amazing performance unfold is to know that Ledger is already gone… Not even thirty! We could have seen him take on films, one after another, and watch in rapt amazement for an entire generation. But now he’s gone and I find that terribly sad. Still, we do have this bizarre gem. Ledger’s Joker is scintillating, sinister, and yet almost pure in his objective: chaos. He has no use for thirty million dollars - “Everything burns!” he says, while lighting a small mountain of cash on fire. This strikes me as somehow utterly true. Trusting the current U.S. executive branch of government is exactly the same. Everything burns. Where can we possibly go after Iraq? Iran? Paris? Paraguay? Everything burns!! What Ledger is giving us in the Joker, is not the corn-fed platitudes and ridiculous posturing of Batman, Gordon, and Dent, he is giving us the real deal, the bonafide disaster that our so called leaders have strewn across the planet. Therefore when the Joker is ridiculing his tormentors and captors by saying there is nothing they can do to him, we realize that he is speaking the truth. When self-justifying fascists crush all their opponents and establish dictatorships, and then proceed to destroy anyone who challenges them, their victims will someday be stripped down to nothing but their own breath, their existence, their consciousness of what is being done to them… and they will rebel. Unfortunately, the American audience just sucks all this up without a moment of awareness. As far as the majority are concerned, the words of the usher who showed us where the emergency exits were located are sufficient: “this flick is awesome, it rules!” But under the surface, I would assert that America is being given a choice of ideologies: either a fascist dictatorship or insanity. Some choice. I reject this completely in favor of another way, namely the rule of law, of habaeus corpus, of the protections guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and by the principle of absolutely nobody being above the law. The law, however, seems to be the problem for us. Enabling as it does such sickening swine as Bush, Cheney, and all the Enrons, Halliburtons, Blackwaters, Wackenhuts, Dyncorps, Lockheeds, and Dr. Strangeloves &#8212; it is the law that needs some restoration. Let us go back to citizens having rights instead of corporations. Then none of us need to become our own Batmans. Then none of us need to become our own Jokers. Needless to say, when the lot of us are pushed to the wall, all bets are off.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"},{"name":"cinema","slug":"cinema","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/cinema/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"comics","slug":"comics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/comics/"},{"name":"freedom","slug":"freedom","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/freedom/"},{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/politics/"},{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/review/"},{"name":"fascism","slug":"fascism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/fascism/"}]},{"title":"The Boat to Orient Point","slug":"the-boat-to-orient-point","date":"2012-07-23T06:56:00.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T01:06:04.000Z","comments":true,"path":"TRAVELS/the-boat-to-orient-point/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/TRAVELS/the-boat-to-orient-point/","excerpt":"It’s hard for me to believe that during my years in NYC I never made it East of Flushing, Queens, but there it is. &#160; So this weekend, when we had a chance to visit our friends on the North coast of Long Island, we decided to drive down to New London and catch the car ferry to Orient Point, the extreme Eastward tip of the island.","text":"It’s hard for me to believe that during my years in NYC I never made it East of Flushing, Queens, but there it is. &#160; So this weekend, when we had a chance to visit our friends on the North coast of Long Island, we decided to drive down to New London and catch the car ferry to Orient Point, the extreme Eastward tip of the island.

We had some wonderful meals, cooked by Vichai and Sophia at their dining room table… which also served as the workspace for Lee and Sophia as they translated Chinese sayings embroidered into traditional Hainan headscarves. While they worked, I lazed around getting a sunburn on the beach and reading M.

But what worried me is that some others began to agree with him, because of the medical transparency issue. But I must say that the whole argument is wrong! &#160; Transparency of our medical records would only be beneficial to all of us if we benefit equally from the results. As it is, without any national or in any way equally distributed health care system, the benefits only accrue to the profit-making medical industry and to the rich who can afford the results. Unfortunately, this incident gave me further pause to reflect on privacy. I am suspicious that elitist interests (such as the Koch Brothers, the Carlyle Group, the financial gangsters) have now fixed on the need to eradicate privacy as a cause cél&#232;bre. &#160;This is curious. &#160;Surely they are not turning into communists, wanting the benefits of everyone in society as a whole to be held above the individual’s rights. This goes directly against their libertarian grain. No, there must be something more insidious to this new attack on privacy…keeping in mind that Internet Privacy is also under continuous attack in the legislature. &#160; &#160;There must be something more purposive behind an attack on the very notion of privacy, at once to destroy it as “right to privacy,” and to declare that it is a myth which doesn’t exist. Might it not be, in fact, that the ruling class want to deliberately erode the notion of privacy, because it is inextricably linked to Liberty?&#160; That is to say, the freedom of an individual to be left alone in their own pursuits, by default, _demands&#160;_a great degree of privacy, does it not? &#160;To eradicate privacy is to instantiate the panopticon, the police state, and strips away the most basic veil of self-protection that we have for our individual freedom. Yet, in the rotten nut-meat that passes for brains among the self-anointed elite, the destruction of privacy is a desirable outcome.&#160; Because, naturally, it assumes that THEY will be doing the watching, and THEY will decide whose privacy and liberty are being abolished, but it could never apply to THEM. &#160;Drunk with power, the elite could not imagine that their own privacy would also be abolished. &#160; How else could any sane human being deny the basic good that derives from privacy? There is a rather excellent post on REDDIT that sums up the benefits of privacy http://goo.gl/E5csH: &#8226; Privacy is freedom &#8226; Invading a person’s privacy can give you access to information about them which you can then use against them, even if that information is not objectively illegal, immoral or unethical &#8226; Privacy is not the same as secrecy. In other words, privacy is not necessarily about hiding bad things. &#8226; The people doing the violation of privacy are not infallible. They are human beings, and as such are liable to corruption. “Who watches the watchmen?” &#8226; The invasion of privacy causes psychological distress. If invasion of privacy is accepted as standard, mass decline in public’s mental well-being will follow. &#8226; A democracy is based (as least in theory) on the government serving the people. If the people want privacy, the government has to grant them privacy. &#8226; Denying privacy hampers free speech, as people may not want to voice unpopular opinions if they know they are constantly being monitored. It also restricts creativity for similar reasons. &#8226; The loss of privacy is tantamount to losing one’s identity, as one is no longer to hold the beliefs or behave in a way consistent with their true selves. How true these points are. There is also a rather good essay by Bruce Schnier, The Eternal Value of Privacy: http://www.schneier.com/essay-114.html Those who would strip away our basic right to privacy are not some benificent angels, trying to heal us…what a preposterous notion! Better to keep in mind what J.S.Mill had to say about Society and the Individual in On Liberty: “The strongest argument against public interference with purely personal conduct is that, when it does interfere, the odds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place.”","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/politics/"},{"name":"social mores","slug":"social-mores","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/social-mores/"},{"name":"civil rights","slug":"civil-rights","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/civil-rights/"}]},{"title":"Biographies of Tanith Lee, James Tiptree Jr, and Jack Vance","slug":"biographies-of-tanith-lee-james-tiptree-jr-and-jack-vance","date":"2012-05-27T17:51:48.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/biographies-of-tanith-lee-james-tiptree-jr-and-jack-vance/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/biographies-of-tanith-lee-james-tiptree-jr-and-jack-vance/","excerpt":"In recent weeks, I’ve been on a biography reading jag, first tearing through The Hidden Library of Tanith Lee, then James Tiptree, Jr., the Double Life of Alice Sheldon, and This is Me, Jack Vance!

Ellison, true to form, raved in his introduction to this story: &#160;”the sf world at large will come to realize what those who’ve read this story in manuscript and galley have come to realize: &#160;we have a new Giant in the genre. &#160;Tiptree is the man to beat this year. &#160;Wilhelm is the woman to beat, but Tiptree is the man.“ Of course, we now know how ironic this must have sounded to Tiptree, who in “real” life was Alice B. Sheldon, a woman writing under a man’s name. &#160; But until you read Julie Phillips book, it is unlikely that you will understand the psychological depth of this “double life,” and the extent to which Sheldon’s pseudonymous personality created complications in a life that was already tortured by self-doubt and a myriad of other problems. &#160; I suppose that I was resisting this book, despite many rave reviews, because I feared the traumatic ending, when I knew that Sheldon would take her own life. What I didn’t know was that Julie Phillips had written such a flat-out brilliant biography. &#160;From Sheldon’s colorful childhood on safari in Africa, to joining the WACs in WWII, to wild times in San Francisco and New Mexico…Phillips has envisioned the life of her subject to much richer and more delightful level of intimacy than I thought was possible. &#160; And she is working with difficult material… Not only was Sheldon bifurcated by her self-generated identity as a male sf writer, but she also spent a lifetime wrestling with more fundamental identity issues, not the least of which was her gender and sexual orientation. &#160; Sheldon was a woman who spent years of her youth being toted around Africa, photographed beside the bleeding corpses of elephants and lions, and trekking through jungles to experience peoples and cultures that her fellow Americans saw only as stereotypes on newsreels and in Hollywood potboilers. But she wasn’t such a delicate fading violet; her main complaint on safari was that her parents would not let her carry and fire her own shotgun. &#160; This seemed awfully unfair, after all, since her flamboyant mother, Mary Hastings Bradley, had occasion to sit down upon a lion that was not quite dead and when it reared up with a terrifying final roar she cooly fired a coup de grace round into the beast’s heart. &#160; Back home at their Hyde Park penthouse in Chicago, Mary Bradley decorated with trophies from their African adventures, and spent a lifetime writing popular novels and speaking about her travels. &#160; How do you grow up in the shadow of such a Mom? That is one of the major themes in Phillips excellent biography, along with Sheldon’s marriages, intellectual life, and career as a photo-intelligence analyst / artist and science fiction author. &#160;Although it didn’t bother me, some readers might be a bit confused by Phillips variable use of “he” or “she” throughout the book, as a way of instantiating the Tiptree / Sheldon identities. &#160; &#160;Ultimately, I think the tactic works, and is handled objectively, along with the other aspects of Sheldon’s life that might otherwise have been easy to over-dramatize. For example, when Sheldon is living in New Mexico and sells a painting in a gallery show (a nude self-portrait), she immediately uses the money to buy herself a top-notch shotgun. &#160; A myriad of details like this are handled as casual asides, though they piqued my interest to the point that I wanted to know what sort of gun Sheldon bought: &#160;what was that Fox double-barreled, choked, CE 20 gauge shotgun? &#160; Of course, it was virtually the same gun that Teddy Roosevelt took on safari in Africa after leaving the presidency, differing only in that Teddy’s FE grade was made with gold inlays, personalized monograms, and stocks made of “four-star” Turkish Circassian walnut, instead of the “one-star” Turkish walnut &#160;and silver engravings supplied with Alice’s CE grade shotgun. And yet, the fact that Sheldon was familiar with guns, from her childhood safaris to her adult hunting and target practice, takes on a morbid edge when we consider that she often spoke of suicide and of having her .38 caliber pistol at hand. &#160;There is an added edge to this potential for violence: &#160;Sheldon spent much of her life taking prescriptions such as benzedrine, dexadrine, and other mind-frazzling drugs. &#160; &#160;Despite the tragic conclusion, I can only admire the great scholarship and fine writing that Phillips accomplished in the “Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon.” On a much lighter note, I picked up “This is Me, Jack Vance! (Or more properly, This is I!).” &#160;Vance was born in 1916, and though he has been blind for decades, he is still happily with us on this Memorial Day weekend of 2012, at the sprightly age of 95. &#160; After listening raptly to the long interview with Vance posted by StarShipSofa (2010), I was keen to read Vance’s autobiography. &#160; As one of sf’s most beloved story-tellers, it is fascinating to hear him tell about his own life, which was not altogether different from his picaresque narratives. Born in California, Vance’s family was fairly well-to-do. &#160;His grandfather, Ludwig Matthias Hoeffler, was a wealthy businessman, who purchased and installed the iconic pugilist statues that front the Olympic Club of San Fancisco. &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; But, owing to the stock market crash and some manipulative relatives, Vance was virtually penniless when he graduated high school. &#160;&#160;Throwing his shoulder to the grind-stone, Vance worked as seasonal fruit-picker, a “monkey-suited” elevator operator, a mining laborer, and in many other odd jobs. &#160; &#160;His eyesight was problematic from an early age, and when WWII came around, in order to avoid a deferment based on that, he memorized the eye chart and joined the merchant marines. After traveling the world on several voyages, Vance enrolled at UC Berkeley (which offered free tuition for California residents back in those halcyon days of Robber Baron dog-eat-dog capitalism…but then today…wait!? &#160;oh never mind…) &#160; &#160;Vance was interested in journalism and his social life centered on the offices of the Berkeley newspaper, The Cal. &#160; It was there that he met two energetic women, one of whom changed the course of journalism, and another who met a terrible fate in the skies over&#160;Jangipara, India. Marguerite Higgins was the tough woman journalist of WWII, working in London, Paris and Germany. &#160;After the war, she was posted as bureau chief in Tokyo for the New York Herald Tribune. &#160;Although she was one of the few correspondents writing from the region when the Korean war broke out, she was ordered to leave by General Walton Walker, who said there was no place for women at the front. &#160; However, instead of meekly packing her bags, Higgins appealed directly to Gen. Douglas MacArthur who agreed to let her stay on the scene and sent a telegram about his decision to the Tribune: &#160;”Ban on women correspondents in Korea has been lifted. Marguerite Higgins is held in highest professional esteem by everyone.” &#160;&#160;Higgins went on to be the first woman to get a pulitzer… Higgins’ and Vance’s friend at The Cal, Anita Whistler, met an untimely end. &#160; She had been teaching on an exchange program in Malaya, and was taking a commercial flight on the Singapore - London route [May 2nd 1953], riding in the first production passenger jet, the British-made de Havilland Comet. &#160; As the aircraft was leaving it’s scheduled stop at Calcutta, it was hit with a sudden monsoon rain and disintegrated over the nearby town of Jangipara. &#160; Only 31 years old, Whistler was lost along with all on board, in an event that led to the total redesign of how the fuselage of jets are constructed, and subsequently paved the way for the success of the commercial jet age. Vance’s autobiography contains a myriad of similar details and anecdotes about his travels. &#160; His style is easy going and fascinating, much like his fiction… light reading that is impossible to put down. &#160; From the pastiche of memories and adventures, it is possible to get a glimpse of Jack Vance the science fiction author, who casually transforms his day to day experiences into far flung adventures and fantasies. &#160; He maintained a rigorous writing schedule (2000 words / day), along with his wife, Norma, who typed up and helped to edit all of his books. &#160; It is easy to picture them, working from the veranda under a thatched roof in Tahiti, or paddling through the lily pads from their house-boat in Kashmir, and to add another wrinkle to the vivid tales found in Jack Vance novels.","categories":[{"name":"HUMAN BEINGS","slug":"HUMAN-BEINGS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/HUMAN-BEINGS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"writers","slug":"writers","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/writers/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"psychology","slug":"psychology","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/psychology/"}]},{"title":"Are you a werewolf, or not?

The interesting aspects of this novel by Lee are hard to enumerate. &#160; There is a three-way bisexual love affair, that is dealt with very tastefully.&#160; There were moments when I was reminded of the other-worldly love affair in C. L. Moore’s _Shambleau_, but Lee’s handling of the affair is much more sensitive. &#160; On the other hand, there is a brutal rape and murder that is utterly senseless. &#160; The murder victim, a young housemaid, had been forcefully raped by Christian the night of her murder… which is a point in the book when one almost wants to toss it aside… and yet, this is pivot point where the real moral questioning begins.&#160; And the realistic lashing out of the main character, who mindlessly tries to hand a bundle silver objects to the chambermaid’s relatives at her funeral, is both painful and bizarre.&#160; Later on, that silver, which at the funeral the peasant drops and flees from in terror, gets neatly reintroduced into the narrative.&#160; And it is the richness of these details, together with the psychological veracity of the major characters, that makes it impossible to stop turning the pages.&#160; Indeed, the climax and ending of the book are a series of self-repudiations that take one’s breath away…not so much for the moral bankruptcy of Christian, but for the effortless prose that has whisked us from the banality of Christian’s past life into a veritable frenzy of witchcraft and necromancy. &#160; Tanith Lee churns out irresistable metaphors the way a sushi chef slices fish.&#160; Go read this book, it’s a delight. Lycanthia fell off the shelf into my hands, just as I was putting away _Nova Swing_, by M. John Harrison. &#160; This is another book that challenges the reader with a cast of very un-loveable, twisted characters who seem to be caught in a time warp of morally ambiguous attitudes. &#160; The very nature of the world where the story takes place is hard to pin down, as it is intruded upon by an aureole that connects to the Event Zone, which is a very strange place indeed. Like the “zone” of Andrei Tarkovsky’s film, _The Stalker, or the orbiting space platform in Tarkovsky’s Solaris_, any person who ventures beyond the aureole will find that reality is warped and that their experience itself cannot be trusted.&#160; The guides who return to such places have major roles in Nova Swing, two of whom appear to be physically deteriorating, while a third seems to have neither heart nor mind, judging from his callous behaviour.&#160; Does he care about the women he is with?&#160; Does he even notice them? &#160; And then there are the “police,” who we would suspect are trying to capture a serial killer, and to find out why alien artifacts are taking human form among the nightclubs of the city. &#160; But as it becomes increasingly apparent that the senior detective’s obsession with his late wife has an ever-creepier edge to it, and the “chopped” assistant, with her super-powers and cyber-biological data feeds, is not altogether rational, the moral ambiguity of the novel seems to be too dense. Nova Swing leaves us nowhere to turn for air or sanity or common ground.&#160; Everyone is a certified mental case, and the streaming hordes of pure black and white cats that flow along the streets for no particular reason become the only symbol of normality in an otherwise absolutely desperate scene full of wasted, drunken louts. &#160; On these rocks, the book comes dangerously close to that point of exhasperation when the reader must hurl it against the wall and be done with it. &#160; Nonetheless, the bizarre realm of the Kefahuchi Tract, with it’s biological tank cultivars, and its entrancing hyper-advanced technologies kept me hanging on. In the first book of this series, Light, I was much closer to tossing the book aside.&#160; Indeed, I recall a major author who mentioned that he did, in fact, hurl Light into the garbage when it became obvious that the serial killer in that book was not going to stop, nor was he going to have to deal with his crimes emotionally. &#160; That was pretty disgusting. &#160; But in Nova Swing, fortunately, that serial killer motif is muted, and Harrison spends more time conjuring up the strangest of scenes, scenes that would make R. A. Lafferty wrinkle his brow both entranced and confused.&#160; &#160; All in all, I’d say that Nova Swing was stylistically captivating, and in certain passages poetic even perhaps brilliant, but as a novel I’d say it was rather too nebulous for the average reader to engage with. &#160; Me?&#160; I’ve been reading M. John’s stuff since the early days of Tegeus Chromis and the _Centauri Device_. &#160; And I’m certainly looking foward to the next Kefahuchi Tract novel. A month or two before reading Nova Swing, I also happened to rip through a book called _Sensation_ by Nick Mamatas. &#160; This book got rave reviews as a ground-breaking SF novel. &#160; I must say that it left me utterly disappointed. &#160; The main character is a narcissistic and indecisive hipster professor in New York, who somehow gets involved with a group of anarchists. &#160; The SF conceit of the plot is that the violent and bizarre actions of the anarchists are manifestations of a secret war between parasitic wasp and spider beings that have infiltrated humankind. &#160; This supposed war between these insectoid masters is presumably a sort of fencing match between the Illuminati (the spiders) and the Ninja Underground (the wasps), and is responsible for everything from surrealism, to assassinations, to that yucky sandwich you had for lunch. &#160; The biggest problem for me with this book was that the only dramatic tension in it seemed to be found in the juxtaposition of the everyday boring solicitude towards the professor and his rotten love-life and the “war” between the wasps and spiders. &#160; Why must the reader try to decode a stupid diary entry by a mediocre character, in order to understand the “deep” story? &#160; This smacks of pretentiousness. &#160; Read it at your own risk. &#160; But if you like the moral ambiguity of a city dweller who does not know whether to get a bagel with lox or go have sex with a woman who doesn’t even like him, then you might be fascinated.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"fantasy","slug":"fantasy","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/fantasy/"},{"name":"morals","slug":"morals","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/morals/"}]},{"title":"Der Twist Beginnt","slug":"der-twist-beginnt","date":"2012-04-11T18:19:13.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T19:44:18.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/der-twist-beginnt/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/der-twist-beginnt/","excerpt":"","text":"Apologies for being absent in recent weeks / months.

Was it interesting to grow up in the Boroughs section of a grimy industrial town?&#160; To be thrown out of high school and get blacklisted from ordinary employment?&#160; Well, if you end up realizing exactly the sort of bean-counting mechanistic life that others end up with; and you end up transforming an entire art form, as well as transforming oneself into a practicing shaman and a fire-breathing dragon of wisdom, then:&#160; yes. Yes, it is interesting. This book has some information about Moore, though it sounded very familiar, as if much of it was transcribed from the biographical film, The Mindscape of Alan Moore.&#160;&#160;&#160; If you are interested in a chronological journey through Alan Moore’s career in comics, this is the book for you, as it is peppered with Moore’s early pages as a comics artist, as well as comics that influenced him, and selections from his own classics, such as V for Vendetta and the Watchmen. For me, it is curious to see that whomsoever approaches him &#8212; whether from comics, or from popular religion, or from social commentary &#8212; none can resist mentioning that Moore has chosen to worship his own deity:&#160; the 2nd Century snake-headed Glycon!&#160;&#160;&#160; Yes, all roads DO lead to Glycon, my friends!&#160;&#160; And yet, there is an impish aspect to Moore’s selection of this tow-headed “rock and roll” pagan god, which you can see in his eyes.&#160;&#160; After all, for the shaman that Moore has become, the choice of a god is a declaration of independence from the ligatures that bind people to corrupt, so-called “established,”&#160; religions.&#160;&#160; Though there is a bit of narcissism involved, (like the design of personal shrines&#160; in John Brunner’s Jagged Orbit,) Moore sets an important precedent for those of us who refuse to be bound into the chains of meaningless traditions.&#160;&#160; Evidently, we must all pass through the same seven veils and cross the same ring of fire to find our unique spiritual paths.

As for the power plant in the background, clearly the whole Spinning Jenny theme, with spinning wheels and wires arcing overhead is a metaphor for the high-voltage transmission lines looming over the power plant. &#160;This is a fascinating socialist propaganda artform, combining the traditions of the folk dance and household necessity of spinning with the construction of new power lines and a national power grid. &#160; The spirited celebration of custom is combined with the opening of a new hydro-electric plant, the human energy and artistry of the dancers is illuminated by the gigantic spotlights surging with the electric power of modern technology! This is the point of the row of candles that illuminates the spinners in the opening shot, to show how the burgeoning modernization of the Soviet state is moving from candlepower to Megawatt generators. All in all, this is an amazing piece of history, when the people were attempting to bury the nightmares of Stalingrad (if not Stalin himself), and move forward into the age of Sputnik and promise of Soviet technology which was at the bleeding edge in many fields, even if those advances had not benefited the population at large. Notice the much different mood in a dance from at least ten years later (1969): &#160;the troupe kicking up their legs in front of the Conquerors of Space Memorial in Moscow! The dancers are wearing revealing white tights and maxi-mini jackets, along with shiny black leather boots. &#160; The enthusiasm is somehow mitigated by the stark geometric background of the Space Memorial, which rises in an arc of titanium up to the small bronze rocket 100m overhead. &#160; This is a stark scene, with the Ostankino Tower in the background, which had been finished in 1967. &#160;There is no crowd of workers, nor any technicians turning mighty spotlights. &#160;At this time there is almost a nervous energy to the production, as if to shout: &#160;hey! &#160;we launched Sputnik in 1957, folks, and have the world’s tallest radio tower… so don’t get too cocky about your Appollo missions, pal!

Through the punks, and the community of zines that followed them, one could feel a vibrant strain of resistance in the low culture, which became passionate form of self-expression. &#160; “Low-brow” visual culture began to gain a huge momentum of it’s own, resurrecting it’s heroes (Robert Williams, Ed Big Daddy Roth, R. Crumb, Panter…), and invigorating galleries with loud works that were formerly consigned to motorcycle tanks and concrete abutments. In the 80s, a strange new “religion” of absurdist, surrealist rebellion &#8212; the Book of the SubGenius &#8212; appeared in the humor sections of major book chains. &#160; &#160;How could the mid-cult myopia of the publishers and distributors have predicted the generation of slackers to follow the arrival of that momentous tome! &#160; Slack, as we know from the pipe-clenching sage, Bob Dobbs, is not at all about slacking off from the patriarchy’s expectations, but rather is to instantly melt all connections to the patriarchy by transmuting oneself into a laughing Mandelbrot set of ectoplasm. In other words, with the SubGenius we moved beyond the problem of master-slave, or capital-labor, to transcendental igneous differentiation. Was it all a hoax? &#160; More importantly, does it matter? If we consider our current cultural landscape (or shatter-scape, with its myriad of conflicting and inter-related paradigms,) we are still very much embedded in the high-cult, mid-cult, mass-cult matrix. &#160;Even though art museums have begun to embrace formerly low-brow culture, and there are books on underground comix and kitsch from such presses as Abrams and Taschen, nonetheless there is ample room for the denigration of the entire society by such tasteless and horrible spectacles as the trend for “reality television.” &#160; Not to mention the debasement of journalism to point that a channel like Fox “news” can exist without being stripped of its broadcast license, while the extremely right-wing CNN, or the phony left-wing NPR can pretend to be presenting more “objective” information. In this scenario, it is no wonder that “alternative” sources of information are far more reliable. &#160;We are living in a war zone of continuous psy-ops. &#160;Should you have any doubt about this, try to accommodate the reality of “corporate citizenship” with $7.7 Trillion that vanished into the maw of FIRE, while non-violent students sitting on a sidewalk are pepper-sprayed directly in the face, and the entire #OWS movement is characterized as a few smelly hippies and homeless people. &#160; The same people running these billion-dollar psy-op boondoggles, hidden among cubicles around the beltway like so many little Wizards of Oz, would have you believe that United States of America needs to live in a state of constant fear, thus making all citizens willing guinea pigs in their experiment to have us strip ourselves and expose our genitals to frequent blasts of body-scanning radiation. &#160; Even in the like-minded enclave of Europe, this degree of insanity is considered beyond the pale and the so-called “full body scan” devices have been banned. Under these circumstances, it is incumbent upon any sane human being to rebel. Of course, the persistent mythology of the mid-cult is that there will be a benign outcome, and that our government, as bad as it is, cannot be actually evil, taken over by by gangs of criminals, torturers, lunatics, and space aliens. &#160; Should you carry on in your own cubicle? &#160;Surround yourself with amulets and prayers and personalized lucky shrines, as weird as anything in Brunner’s _Jagged Orbit_? &#160;Because after all, what can you really do? Perhaps Bob Dobbs was right… &#160;the best choice is slack. &#160; It is then heartwarming to see the success of the _Idler’s Glossary and the follow-up volume, the Wage Slave’s Glossary_, in which the essence of slack is conveyed in the seemingly innocent format of a list of words and definitions. &#160; It’s worth listening to the interview with co-author Mark Kingwell, for some of his take on the terms, such as “wage slave” which was: “popularized by the Lowell mill girls, though the term is bit older. &#160; The idea is that you have a job, but you are enslaved to the conditions of your own labor because you have to have that wage to live.&#160; It’s rooted in Marxist analysis of labour and consumption.&#160; And the idea is that you can’t get out from under, because in a classic situation, you have to buy your supplies at the company store, so the wages the company pays you are channeled right back into the company.&#160; You may not be a chattel slave, in the ancient sense, in that you are physically owned by the company or by a person, but you’re enslaved by these conditions.&#160; At the time there was a lively debate between socialists and anarchists, socialists wanted to improve working conditions through unionization and collective bargaining, and arnarchists wanted to say, look, it’s this whole idea of work that needs to be put into question.&#160; And the more you cooperate with management, the more you perpetuate the system.” This is straight out of Kropotkin, if I’m not mistaken. &#160;Then Kingwell compares idler with slacker: “There is a distinction between the idler and the slacker.&#160; the slacker is someone who is self-consciously avoiding work, as a result the slacker is still bound by dictates of work as something that he or she is avoiding.&#160; The idler, by contrast, is taking time and striking out in a whole new direction of personal preference and self development.” The beauty of the “idler,” in Kingwell’s definition, is the rejection of the entire working paradigm. &#160; There is a not so subtle sub-text which is the obvious suggestion that anarchism is really the solution. On the other, hand, I would take issue with the usage of “idler” and “slacker” here, because I believe that there ought to be some leeway in the term “slacker” which can include the anarchistic bent of Bob Dobb’s “slack” and which is both creative and completely free of any dictates of work. &#160; But that is quibbling. Even more amusing is to listen to co-author Joshua Glenn’s interview with Michael Dresser, in which the host shows himself to be so utterly ossified and extinct (he wants to vote for a John Wayne - Fonzie ticket in the Presidential election) that Glenn’s entire radical objective sails cleanly over his head. So, drop away the seven veils, cast off your chains, and RISE UP as a free human being. &#160; Then DIY, amigos!

Who is in danger and who is being protected? In fact, the majority of Americans have seen their real incomes shrink, or their jobs vanish, or their homes foreclosed, or their children impoverished. It is the majority of Americans, the 99%, who are in danger. Isn’t that obvious? And yet your orders are coming from the 1%, that is to say the rich and super-rich, who have reaped gigantic profits from the horrible suffering they have created. Their financial schemes, such as hedge funds and bundled real estate securities, are the ROOT CAUSE of the economic crisis we are now facing, and yet they are being protected? Protected from what? They are criminals. Indeed, it is the criminal class of super-rich financiers, together with their OWNED politicians, judges, lawyers, and media streams that should be punished… not the victims of their blood-sucking greed! Police of America, please do not harm your brothers and sisters who are shouting for justice, for equality, for fairness in the streets. JOIN THEM! Protect the protestors! You know they are speaking the truth, and that the puppet-masters in their billion dollar hide-outs are manipulating you and expecting you to become cold, callous monsters. They are turning you into unfeeling robots, by demanding that you attack non-violent protesters. Is this not crazy and upside-down? Believe me, men and women in uniform, the trouble makers and evil-doers are in gated communities and bullet-proof penthouses… not standing in the cold rain with cardboard signs! Police of America, join the 99% and bust the heads of the evil bastards who have destroyed our nation and want to turn you into unthinking animals! Use your training and intelligence and tools to protect the real patriots by cracking down on the super corrupt! If you uphold the motivations of the Occupy Movement you will be protecting Freedom of Speech, Equality, Social and Economic Justice, and you will be firmly standing on the higher ground. By acting within the TRUE word of the law, which is to serve and protect the people of America and to punish those who would harm us, then the 99% of America who are now being enslaved will have your back! We will stand with you! Police of America, you must join the protests for Truth, for Justice, and stand with the protesters! Otherwise we shall never see a transformation of society for the good, the righteous, and the ethical. We will only see you turn into beasts under the control of blood-thirsty villains. We &#8212; the 99% are not attacking you &#8212; we are fighting for the necessary change in a system that is corrupt and out of control. It is time to turn the tables and arrest the real criminals… Police of America, do not take orders from vampires. Stand with the those who are fighting for the land of the free and the home of the brave. The 1% do not own America. They own nothing! Banish their predatory mind-control and restore the moral compass of our nation. ** **","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/politics/"},{"name":"social mores","slug":"social-mores","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/social-mores/"},{"name":"fascism","slug":"fascism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/fascism/"}]},{"title":"OccupyMeme","slug":"occupymeme","date":"2011-11-06T17:39:24.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:13:47.000Z","comments":true,"path":"IDEAS/occupymeme/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/IDEAS/occupymeme/","excerpt":"","text":"As Occupy Wall Street has grown from a demonstration to a social movement, it is inspiring to see many good things emerging. Perhaps the most basic triumph of the Occupy movement has been to wrench the agenda away from the preposterous “all terror all the time” and “infinite war” protocols that have infested the public consciousness, and to refocus the agenda of social and political discourse. This is in itself a small miracle, and I praise everyone who has struggled through a cold night or joined a general assembly for having launched the “Occupy” meme into the global consciousness! In addition, I have to thank all the innovative contributors to the Occupy movement who did things like form the general assembly, form sustainable sub-groups that support the community, and provide for practical matters like bicycle-powered generators! Way to be people! If there is anyone still in doubt about what the “demands” are in the Occupy movement, I can only recommend everyone to look at the interesting chart of General Assembly discussions (linked below) and then ask yourself: which of these issues is pertinent to me? After that, discuss them with your friends, your family, your neighbors, your elected officials, your cat, your dog, your conscience. Above all, demand of America a moral compass!

The panel topics had their usual sweep of the field, from Mark Twain, to Mark Clifton, and most places interstitial…yet the mood of the conference was clearly influenced by the passing of two major figures in SF’s new wave: Joanna Russ and Tom Disch. In memorializing Disch, can you imagine a more appropriate set of panelists than Charles Platt, John Crowley, John Clute, Chip Delany, and Gregory Feeley? It is always interesting to be part of a living literary tradition &#8212; sf fandom &#8212; that celebrates itself, its heroes and villains, its friendships and bitter feuds, by directly mixing the authors, editors, fans and miscellaneous hangers on in a single venue. The kickoff panel on Friday was “Classic Non-Fiction: The Jewel Hinged Jaw,” [JHJ] which provided a concise review of Samuel R. Delany’s career in the literary criticism of SF. The panelists described their first encounters with JHJ, and how it affected their view of what Science Fiction was and how to read it. Barry Malzberg complained: “When JHJ came out in 1978 I was already 39 years old, which was already about 15 years too late for it to really have any effect on me as a writer. And I think I want to disagree with its fundamental premise…although I’m not sure of that. (laughter) That is to say that Delany declares SF to have its own special reading protocols that are necessry in order to understand it. But, I think that this position has to be understood in the light of the earlier books by Blish (Issue at Hand, More Issues at Hand) and Knight (In Search of Wonder), which anthologized their critical essays from the 1950s and early 60s. In those books, the authors essentially want to treat SF on its own merits, and not segregate SF into a specialized genre that some people are incapable &#8212; perhaps genetically incapable &#8212; of understanding. Blish insisted that SF needs to be evaluated in the same way as any literature. The core of Delany’s argument also appeared in his essay Science Fiction and “Literature” - or, The Conscience of the King (Analog May 79). [Reprinted in _Visions of Wonder_, 1996] As for JHJ, it’s a brilliantly wrong-headed book… but then again, after 35 years, I can’t be so sure that he was wrong. And in any case, the most valuable part of the book to me are the auto-biographical sections, which are terrifyingly good.” It so happened that Chip Delany was in the audience, so he had a chance to chime in: “When I wrote the book there was a background of events in literary criticism in general, tending to reject the idea that criticism had to be thematic and revolve around analysis of the plots, and characters. By the late 60s and early 70s there was a whole trend in criticism that was moving towards treating the texts themselves as language. JHJ was really my attempt to discuss SF texts as language, and bring SF criticism up to date. I probably should have made that really clear at the time, but I wanted to appear much more fresh and innovative than I really was.” (laughter) Elizabeth Hand followed up by asking Malzberg: “Is there a sense that JHJ was a watershed moment in SF criticism?” “There was no before / after effect in the case of JHJ,” said Malzberg, “it was actually a step along an arc that continued throughout the 70s. If you want to draw a line in the sand, you’d have to go back to the criticism of Blish and Knight. JHJ was really more like a report from the field. And it was the atuobiographical aspects that were so strong, which really went to center of Chip’s experience as a writer. If you think about how SF books are marketed and then written, probably 47 out of every 50 books at that time were sold before they were written. But Chip Delany was someone who said &#8216;No, I’m going to write my book first, and then sell it.’ The changes and effects that his decision had on him is what makes the book so powerful. But it didn’t really make a huge impact on the field and the way SF was read; not nearly as much as when Knight quit writing criticism completely in 1961. He just walked away from it completely, and that was something that people felt.” David Hartwell pointed out: “Another big impact would have been the unpublished collected critical essays of Joanna Russ. Clear, concise, funny, and beautifully written…they would have been hugely important.” The conversation also touched on Delany’s essay, About Five Thousand One Hundred and Seventy-Five Words (1969) [reprinted in Thomas D. Clareson’s SF: The Other Side of Realism], and the way in which science fiction demands a certain kind of training and vocabulary to understand. It is not genetic, but simply a way of learning the possibilities of language, in order to understand that “the door dilated,” is a literal description, while “her world exploded” is metaphorical. “Like: he was singing a duet with a can-opener,” added Hartwell. Malzberg: “How many people here know where that reference is from? It was Henry Kuttner’s Proud Robot, from Astounding, October 1943. In any case the real problem I had with JHJ was that it essentially elevated the same point Sam Moskowitz was making 40 years earlier. And that was like gifting Moskowitz with both literacy and an IQ of 180, which was scary.” Or, just watch the entire panel on Video! Thanks, Scott Edelman! It was a great opening panel, and provided a sweet intro to the sessions that followed… more of which in future posts. Meanwhile, it was great to see Mark Borok, Alan Hanscom, and to talk with Malzberg, Don Keller, Paul Di Fillipo, Liza Groen Trombi, Cecilia Tan, Neil Clarke, Pam Phillips, Ed Koenig, and many others. Plus it was a real thrill to meet Luis and Karan Ortiz of Non-Stop Press! Luis sold me two more of his amazing SF art books, for which I’m really grateful.

But, he adds, who is to know the fate of his bones, or how often he is to be buried?” This passage stuck in my mind, and seemed worthy of further inquiry… but who would have predicted that the next book I happened to pick up from my SF pile was _Them Bones_ by Howard Waldrop, which includes several quotes from _Urn Buria_l, including the identical passage! Waldrop gets the exact text much closer to the original: “To be gnawed out of our graves, to have our souls made drinking bowls, and our bones turned into pipes, to delight and sport our enemies, are tragical abominations, escaped in burning burials.” Waldrop also uses the other quote in its fuller form: “But who knows the fate of his bones, or how often he is to be buried? who hath the oracle of his ashes, or whither they are to be scattered?” According to James Eason’s excellent transcription of the original 1658 edition of Browne’s Hydriotaphia, Urne-Buriall. or, a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchrall Urnes Lately Found in Norfolk, the original text reads: “To be knav’d out of our graves, to have our sculs made drinking-bowls, and our bones tuned into Pipes, to delight and sport our Enemies, are Tragicall abominations, escaped in burning Burials.“ Did Waldrop intentionally change “sculs” to “souls”? One assumes so, because he is far too attentive to the usage of every word for that to be a mistake. And yet, how interesting! Skulls as drinking bowls are a dime a dozen &#8212; just visit a Tibetan Buddhism exhibit &#8212; but souls as drinking bowls are something else altogether. As for Sebald, eliding the reference to the end of the sentence (&#8216;escaped in burning Burials’), he transforms the quote from a practical discussion of interment and cremation, to a philosophical comment on the vagaries of mortal beings and their ultimate fate. Are these misremembered passages? Hardly believable from two stylists such as Waldrop and Sebald. But the synchronicity of reading these two books in sequence cannot be written off so easily… More fascinating details on Browne’s skull, dug up by erstwhile Eason, are here.","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"writers","slug":"writers","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/writers/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"skulls","slug":"skulls","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/skulls/"}]},{"title":"Solaris Soundtrack Artwork","slug":"solaris-soundtrack-artwork","date":"2011-05-04T15:40:35.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/solaris-soundtrack-artwork/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/solaris-soundtrack-artwork/","excerpt":"","text":"The haunting soundtrack by Eduard Artemyev for the masterpiece SF film Solaris has been floating around the inter-tubes.

Let me take them in the order that I read them, to explain. Purely by chance, I picked up a copy of Echo X [1960] from Filthy Pierre&#8216;s freebie table at Boskone. To be honest, I was mostly attracted by the Jack Gaughan cover, which didn’t prepare me at all for the post-WWII narrative, which seemed like a hybrid of Catch-22 and SF. The story has been very well summarized by Keith Graham, and goes briefly as follows: A Canadian reporter’s life was deeply scarred by his experiences in the war. He was part of a bombing mission that struck the home-town of his first lover in Southern France; his best friend was killed by flak during another mission; his attempt to help a girl whose family was killed during the blitz in London turns into a complex, life-long relationship. As an ex-pat after the war, the reporter falls in love with the girl from London, (who in the meantime has grown up to become a leading scientist,) and they both get involved in experimental research with Dr. Morescu, yet another brilliant, but tragic survivor of the recent war. The experiments succeed in opening up a channel to a parallel world, a near-duplicate of our own Earth, except that WWII never happened. Not only did his best friend survive on the alternate Earth, but the “parallel” best friend arrives on a reconnaissance mission, along with “parallel” duplicates of both the narrator and his girlfriend, the scientist. In the course of the novel, the horrors of war, and the social injustices of our Earth are laid bare, and the reporter is placed in the difficult - perhaps impossible - position of trying to defend his own Earth, while at the same time being deeply critical of it himself. Only by hiding the stark realities and evils of his own world could he succeed in convincing the parallel Earth to open up long-lasting ties and to share their superior technologies and social norms, which are free from war, from inequality, and where political harmony was established between the nations and people of the world. Echo X is an interesting, wonderful book, with a style reminiscent of Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut. What I’m calling the metahistorical aspect of this book is seen in the way that our own Earth’s history is held up for direct comparison with a parallel Earth. The prospect of revolutionary change, should our Earth be deemed “worthy,” is the means of bringing the benefits of one dimension across to another. The characters of the book are also metahistorical actors, in that the “parallel” versions of the narrator and his paramour, get mixed up with one another in the sack. The consequences of these inter-dimensional affairs provide the emotional conclusion, while the larger metahistorical possibilities of inter-dimensional relations are never resolved. The mixed results (apparently good on a personal level, but ambiguous, quite possibly dooming the Earth to more wars and suffering on another) are left by the narrator as an enigma for the world to decide. Like a dozen roses that shall never fade, the anonymous narrator, concludes his “hastily” written account, and leaves it for posterity to see if his observations remain attractive or meaningful. It’s a personal story, and one wonders how much of the author, Ben Barzman, is not embodied in the Canadian reporter. Surely the social commentary and anti-war slant of the book draw directly from Barzman’s life and political activities, and the similarities increase when we take into account that Barzman fled the Hollywood blacklists with his wife, Norma, to live as an ex-pat in Paris. After Echo-X, I happened to crack open Chekhov’s Journey [1980], by Ian Watson. In alternating chapters, it becomes apparent that the story is taking place in three different worlds, or time streams, and that some sort of convergence is inevitable. The “contemporary” track involves a film project that has gone to Siberia in order to isolate themselves and to conduct a sort of psychological / hypnosis experiment. The experiment involves inducing a transference of the author Anton Chekhov’s personality onto the lead actor, Mikhail, in order to recreate the journey that Chekhov took to Siberia in 1890. The second track involves the historical Anton Chekhov, as he travels into the hinterlands of Siberia. Slowly, Chekhov’s journey begins to morph from the “historical facts” and to become a parallel history. In that alternate 1890, Chekhov encounters Baron Nikolai Vershinin, who is obsessed with the strange comet that was reported to have exploded over Tunguska in 1888. Bankrolled by the strident and promiscuous widow, Countess Zelenina, and joined by the young genius, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the “historical” track sets off to explore the impact zone of Tunguska. The warping of “facts” in this second track is unknown to its characters, but is known and discussed among the “contemporary” track actors, whenever Mikhail snaps out of his hypnotic trance. Therefore, the discrepancy of the 1888 explosion and the “real” event that occurred in Tunguska in 1908, becomes a subject of discussion for the “contemporary” track characters. A third, “future” track unfolds when the experimental interstellar spaceship, K. E. Tsiolkovsky, is about to engage it’s flux drive for the first time under the leadership of Commander Anton Astrov. In this scenario, the super-advanced Soviet Union is preparing to launch an interstellar space probe, and a jealous United States is poised to interfere with the flux engines at the moment of ignition. Consequently, the flux drive fails to engage properly and the unlucky crew is sent plummeting into a space-time warp. Aware of their own historical “facts,” the crew of the ship tries desperately to bring the flux drive back under control in time to escape the Earth’s atmosphere and to avoid burning up in a huge fireball. Of course, as it turns out, their trajectory puts them on a collision course with Tunguska, Siberia. But the “oddity” is that their calculations indicate a temporal impact of the year 1888, instead of 1908, when they should have arrived! Watson’s ingenious plotting, action, and characters make Chekhov’s Journey worth reading multiple times. And Watson effortlessly manages to weave a metahistorical narrative out of the tension and discrepancies that appear between the historical, contemporary, and future tracks. An altogether great achievement! It was with a rather skeptical outlook that I started to read And Having Writ, by Donald Bensen, something I bought from the Mind’s Eye stacks at Arisia. There is no indication on the jacket copy, but it turns out that the book is: “a smoothly humorous sf novel set in an alternate world engendered by the survival of the aliens whose crash-landing caused the Siberian Tunguska explosion of 1908.” John Clute This was a rather mind-boggling coincidence having just put down Chekhov’s Journey, to say the least! But even more intriguing was the metahistorical threads holding the book together. Indeed, one of the alien visitors, is a trained “Metahistorian.” In the novel this profession studies of the deep trends of society from which there are inevitable consequences, and therefore it is Metahistorian who is expected to have the keenest understanding of any alien culture. That being said, the “Metahistorian” in And Having Writ seems more like a cross between futurologist and anthropologist, as we commonly used those terms in the 1970s. In my view, the fascinating aspects of Bensen’s novel had to do with the subtle distortions of “historical facts” that creep into view. In the first case, their direct impact with Earth (apparently the true “cause” of the Tunguska explosion) is narrowly avoided by the alien Integrator, who is the crew member who can see and manipulate the “patterns” of the Universe and living beings. Then, in their various dealings and encounters with Teddy Roosevelt, H.G. Wells, Thomas Edison, King Edward VII, the Wright Brothers, and a host of other characters, the alien visitors manage to introduce ideas or subtle changes into the “real” world that cause it to metamorphose into a “different” world. The cheerful and seemingly careless way in which the naive aliens encounter famous figures of their day is quite amusing, and keeps the pace of the book moving crisply. Later in the story, after the Metahistorian’s scheme has apparently hopelessly failed - he intended to expedite WWI in order to jump-start a technological revolution which would help them to repair their spaceship - the aliens become bored and decide to go into a stasis mode and await more hopeful eventualities in the far future. They are surprised to be revived a mere 17 years later [the quasi-year 1933], to find that the world not only avoided war but went into a technological hyper-rennaissance. Their spaceship has been repaired and they are sent back on their exploration of the stars by a completely changed and more harmonious human race. However, the clever conceit of the conclusion is that the “trick” that the Integrator used to prevent them from exploding over Siberia not only saved their lives, but also “branched” them into an alternate Universe. That explains why the Metahistorian’s predictions were incorrect, because they were based on what should have happened in the alternate Universe, not what actually happened in their current manifestation. This produced a cozy feeling when I read it. Certainly, I would rather like to think that the inevitability of the savagely stupid reality of my current world - a planet laid waste by greedy capitalist corporations and blood-thirsty psychopaths - can simply branch off into a better alternate Universe! Indeed, why can’t any catalyzing instance create this alternate dimension? That, for me at least, is a heart-warming thought. Although physicists theorize them, science fiction authors instantiate them, and spiritualists seek to manifest them, there is no proof of such crossing paths of alternate universes…but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen! So it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut always said. Isn’t it a fine indicator to have the synchronicity of these three novels falling into my hands randomly, one after the other? Well, I will take as a fine, in any case. -Merrick Lex Berman","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"futurism","slug":"futurism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/futurism/"},{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"transreality","slug":"transreality","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/transreality/"}]},{"title":"Boskone 48 Art Exhibit  -  Audio-Visual Reconstruction","slug":"boskone-48-art-exhibit-audio-visual-reconstruction","date":"2011-03-07T03:07:10.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/boskone-48-art-exhibit-audio-visual-reconstruction/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/boskone-48-art-exhibit-audio-visual-reconstruction/","excerpt":"At Boskone 48, not only were there great works of Greg Manchess, Omar Rayyan, and Bob Eggleton, among others, taking up several rows of panels, but there was also an entire wall dedicated to an exhibit of original SF and Fantasy paintings!

Years later, when I read Earl Kemp’s article, Cherry Pink and Uncle Milty Time, I was amazed by the number of covers Luros had painted during the 40s and 50s, before his career as a porno publisher took off. It’s interesting to learn about the intersection between science fiction illustration, fandom, porn, and obscenity trials, that was personified in the career of Milton Luros and his various publishing companies. Probably the best articles on this unlikely cultural stew are by Victor Banis, Paperback Virgin and Tony Jacobs, The Luros Skin Magazines, both of which appear in Earl Kemp’s amazing eI zine. (Note: neither of these articles is Safe for Office Viewing.) The actual findings of the trial, in which Luros’ “nudist” magazines were eventually found to be neither obscene nor prurient (for the time being), is fascinating reading all by itself, and was a landmark case in 1968 that paved the way for many other publishers. But let’s go back to Luros’ artwork. Many of the covers feature some sort of struggles or embraces at close quarters. A man and woman in tight-fitting air helmets are shown in a misty landscape. It is hard to tell if the man is restraining her, or helping her not to faint. On another cover a red-skinned alien (with a metal collar and chain around his neck) wrestles with a man who is brandishing a dagger. They are battling in the shining presence of a glamorous woman, whose arms are stretched up behind her neck in a languorous pose, exposing her swaying breasts in a racy gown. With heavy eyes closed in casual disregard, the woman’s figure is surrounded by Luros’ characteristic white backlight, around which a cascade of colors drift down like droplets of mist. Clearly, it is the man who is after her with the dagger, while the alien troll is preventing him from getting closer to her pool of golden waters. In two covers from the early 1940s, there are no glamorous women, but both feature aerial combat, which is easy to understand in the midst of WWII, and only five years since the Luftwaffe decimated Guernica. One cover shows a green man strapped to a personal sized turbo propeller wing, with guns blasting over each shoulder. The simple edges and shapes are reminiscent of James Allen St. John, and here the white backlight is reserved as an accent for the facial features. Another painting from roughly the same time uses the white backlight as the horizon, in between a human operated airship that is firing down from the orange sky, onto a field of bald, green-faced aliens. The central figure, an alien being struck by enemy fire, with his space helmet shattered and his pistol suspended in stop-action before his upthrust hand is gorgeously rendered. The front of his body is framed in the harsh white light, and his purple suit blends round his back into red, but is covered (very unrealistically) by his backpack, which seems to be lit in a completely different manner. For some reason the wacky play of light sources in this painting, which are not possible in the real world, work perfectly in the realm of the imagination. Among these early images is another painting of a dark-haired woman fainting in the arms of an alien. In this case, the woman is relaxed, unconscious, her generous figure draped in a silk nightgown. Her captor, a purple suited alien, is sporting a dutch-boy hair attachment and sort of radio antenna on his head, while flying skyward into outer space. The backlight here is seen as a supersonic vapor trail, and white glow behind the alien’s face. But our alien is not alone. His colleagues are zooming away with their own women (who have blonde and chestnut hair, so that we know this is a mass ascension of alien kidnappers and not some trick with mirrors!) The beauty of this painting by Luros is in the simplicity of the image and the effect that is achieved with economy of details. The alien’s hands are barely rendered darts, while the sleeping woman’s face and hair are as perfect as a cosmetic ad. Perhaps the most dramatic of Luros’ early covers is one depicting a greenish female robot, raising a dagger to strike at a struggling woman in a red dress. Rivets line the temples of metallic woman, whose aquiline features, high cheekbones and almond eyes are accented by a weird Babylonian hairstyle and jutting metal cones for breasts. By contrast, her victim is an ordinary looking woman, her shape concealed by a lumpy dress, her scream being choked by the iron grip on her throat, and her hair disappearing beyond the edge of the canvas. Here the sky is black, with faint beams of searchlights sweeping the distant darkness for symmetrical streams of invading spacecraft. The highlight is boldly framing the robot attacker (but not her victim), and Luros once again shows how deftly he can warp reality to serve the needs of his imagery.

His illustration for Mark Clifton’s story Hang Head, Vandal! (April 1962) has always fascinated me. It’s an image of a spacesuit being used as a scarecrow, propped up on a post so that it floats above a flat plane by a few inches. Tufts of straw are poking out of ragged holes in the suit,which is missing it’s left hand and right foot, and more straw is brimming out of the open visor of the helmet. The flatly rendered landscape, made up of a few perspective lines trailing away into the distance, and the strange lime green sky beyond a cloud of purple and black, are like cartoon backgrounds, while the harsh pink and yellow highlights on either side of the gray spacesuit keeps our attention locked on the central figure. At first glance, it looks almost like a corpse. But after a second look, the scarecrow suit is strangely eerie. The overall effect becomes psychological, and could just as easily have illustrated a story by J. G. Ballard as Mark Clifton. Clifton, in fact, worked as a corporate psychologist. He was clearly one of the best writers dealing with psi powers, as Barry Malzberg and Judith Merrill demonstrated in their great anthology: The Science Fiction of Mark Clifton. Birmingham painted at least a dozen other SF covers during the early 60s, for Amazing, Fantastic, and Analog. Among those my favorites are the covers for Plane Jane in September 1962, and Spawn of Doom from December 1961. These images also have floating figures. In the case of Plane Jane, a woman with closed eyes seems to levitate diagonally amidst a three dimensional matrix of colored planes and spheres. In Spawn of Doom, a space-suited figure is floating through a shattered window towards a display case which holds a strange volcanic rock, and out of the rock a pseudopod of red tendrils has broken through the glass of the case. All three of these covers achieves a wierd effect without excessive violence or dramatic expressions, which is probably why I liked them so much. Other covers of interest were the illustrations for Sunfire (Sep 1962) and The Unteleported Man (Dec 1964). Although Birmingham’s other covers were sometimes funny, they never achieved the same impact.

Makarov&#160; was born in 1921 at the town of Biisk (in the Altai region) to a very poor peasant family.&#160;&#160; After moving from Biisk to Osmk, then to Leningrad, Makarov was fortunate to be accepted into a special program for talented youth at the Leningrad Academy of Fine Arts&#160; in 1935.&#160; He won several awards while studying there, but was expelled from the school for brawling with another student.&#160; For a while he found work at the Hermitage and with a circus troupe, where he performed and painted posters. Makarov was drafted as an aviator when the war started, but was shot down on his first mission (as a gunner), after which he was sent to the marines, where he was injured again.&#160; After his recovery, he was transferred to the Pacific fleet where he served as naval theatre artist.&#160; Later he also worked under the lend-lease program, flying dangerous missions.&#160; In 1944, he was involved in operation that went down at sea, and spent 40 minutes in freezing waters before being rescued.&#160; He suffered from this for many years and was virtually disabled, although he also went on to serve in Manchuria during the final years of the war. After his discharge in 1946, he searched for work and again worked for a time as an artist in the theater.&#160;&#160; He happened to meet the author Valentin Kataev, who liked his drawings and who commissioned him to illustrate the manuscript of his book “For the Power of the Soviets” published in 1949.&#160; This was Makarov’s first work as a book illustrator.&#160; He went on to illustrate more than 2,000 books, including the “Library of adventure and science fiction” and the “Library of Soviet science fiction”.

That con was a very early one-off Star Trek show (which seems to have vanished from this dimension without a trace) and was held in Albuquerque around 1974 or 1975. The con featured a recreation of the Enterprise bridge, made of crude plywood and painted black, and George Takei was there, along with some other cast members whom I’ve forgotten. The reason I attended was to see A. E. Van Vogt, and to have him sign the paperbacks I’d been reading and collecting. He signed my copies of War Against the Rull and The Battle of Forever. In the first, he wrote: “Good luck, good wishes, good future!” all over the title page. I still have that on my shelf. I’m not sure what happened to Battle of Forever, but I recall that he inscribed it as: “My farthest out story!” Recently I was poking around the bookshelf looking for good alien images (to be shown at an Arisia panel in January), and I starting leafing through this copy of Startling Stories from Nov 1948. One thing I discovered was that Van Vogt also signed his story Domain, which appeared in this issue. Another thing I found out, on the editorial page, was that this was Van Vogt’s first appearance in Startling. But what most attracted my attention were the incredible black and white illustrations for Against the Fall of Night.

That con was a very early one-off Star Trek show (which seems to have vanished from this dimension without a trace) and was held in Albuquerque around 1974 or 1975. The con featured a recreation of the Enterprise bridge, made of crude plywood and painted black, and George Takei was there, along with some other cast members whom I’ve forgotten. The reason I attended was to see A. E. Van Vogt, and to have him sign the paperbacks I’d been reading and collecting. He signed my copies of War Against the Rull and The Battle of Forever. In the first, he wrote: “Good luck, good wishes, good future!” all over the title page. I still have that on my shelf. I’m not sure what happened to Battle of Forever, but I recall that he inscribed it as: “My farthest out story!” Recently I was poking around the bookshelf looking for good alien images (to be shown at an Arisia panel in January), and I starting leafing through this copy of Startling Stories from Nov 1948. One thing I discovered was that Van Vogt also signed his story Domain, which appeared in this issue. Another thing I found out, on the editorial page, was that this was Van Vogt’s first appearance in Startling. But what most attracted my attention were the incredible black and white illustrations for Against the Fall of Night. Since I couldn’t seem to find existing scans of these images anywhere on the internet, I decided to scan them for everyone to enjoy. These spectacular aliens, with their shiny robotic bodies and enormous tentacled eyeballs for heads, are simply iconic! It’s hard to know whether Earle Bergey painted his superb cover based on the black and white illustrations or if the illustrations were modeled on his painting. However, since Bergey typically was a master of the human figure, (and his trademark soaring women with metal brassieres), this extraordinary image may not have been his own invention. The question then is: who did these illustrations? The delicate inking and cross-hatching is really wonderful! It is somewhat reminiscent of Virgil Finlay, but lacks a signature, which means it is almost surely not by Finlay, who was already at the peak of his career by 1948. Unfortunately, I’m not a collector and have no other copies at hand to use for comparison. If anyone has suggestions about who this wonderful illustrator is, please let me know!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"aliens","slug":"aliens","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/aliens/"},{"name":"tentacles","slug":"tentacles","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/tentacles/"}]},{"title":"Pulp Life: A Major Exhibition of Charles Binger Art","slug":"pulp-life-a-major-exhibition-of-charles-binger-art","date":"2010-12-17T03:56:40.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/pulp-life-a-major-exhibition-of-charles-binger-art/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/pulp-life-a-major-exhibition-of-charles-binger-art/","excerpt":"The amazing works of Charles Ashford Binger will be shown in the first major exhibition of his works in 45 years! “Charles Binger: A Pulp Life“ will open at the La Luz de Jesus Gallery in Hollywood, CA on January 7th and run through the end of the month.

Binger’s interesting career spanned from movie posters and portraits, to ground-breaking science fiction covers in the 1950s, and hard-boiled detective pulps. His style has been characterized as utilizing “impeccable composition, rendered in a painterly style over roughened textures.” I would hasten to add that Binger was able to incorporate elements of cubism, realism, impressionism, and abstract expressionism into his works…often as not by combining them into a single canvas! Consider, for example, the artist’s fanciful depiction of Frederic Brown’s What Mad Universe (1954): where a lightly washed illustration of some buildings look flattened into cubist shapes, surrounded by vivid splashes of yellow and red. Sprinting down the center of the composition are some ridiculous little demons, who seem to be flanking the figure of a very self-confident woman who is posed in a defiant stance and wearing some very strange bright red high-heels. The protagonist, a man in a suit-jacket stands, stunned and defenseless, in the foreground, as some kind of jet fighter battle rages over the twisting cityscape. You’ve got to love this cover for how simple it seems, and how masterfully it hangs together! Some scrubbed on orange pastels make the image looked like it is being torn apart. For those who appreciate this sort of “rough textured” rendering, there are some wonderful surprises in store at the upcoming La Luz de Jesus exhibit! Take a close look at this marvelous portrait of Yul Brynner: Man, Mitchell Hooks himself would’ve approved! But there are some other gems in the show from Binger’s paperback fiction days, for example the covers for Southwest (1952) and The Gentlemen (1957): In the Southwest cover, a perfectly drawn gaucho is cleaning a pistol, but his red embroidered suit and yellow blanket are pure Hollywood, as is the brash tilt of his wide-brimmed hat. Rising up like smoke from fret-boards of his guitar, is the image of an astonishingly beautiful woman, who is gazing over her shoulder at the gaucho as he puffs a cigaret in front of a supercilious smile. This canvas is just brilliant! It combines kitsch, Freudian symbolism, superb handling of light and color, with an irresistible and magnetic self-mockery. The Gentlemen, by contrast, plunges us into a some backwater jungle, where Binger has framed the image in dense foliage. Crisp and wavering leaves in the foreground fade into ragged shanks of tropical trees and grasses in the distance. One of the “Gentlemen” in question seems to be restraining the other, who has been savagely whipping a topless woman. Welts of broken skin where she has been beaten are the most vivid red in the painting, while the rest is handled with flawless and more subtle hues. The woman’s chestnut brown hair is framed by the white petticoat wrinkled around her waist, and in the distance, the melting orange of the setting sun. The eerie quality of the bestial scene is heightened by the lack of drama in the features of the three figures, who seem distant, almost bored with the action. Most mysterious of all is the woman’s face, completely shrouded in her own hair and revealing only the tiniest hint of wincing pain on her lips. Although it’s tempting to simply declare these paintings superior to their contemporaries of 1950s paperback covers, we have to consider that the competition was unbelievably talented: James Avati, Mitchell Hooks, Bob McGinnis, and a host of others were also cranking out fantastic illustrations at a mile a minute… Still, I’m a great admirer of Charles Binger’s pulp covers, with their defiant women and smirking men, and it’s a great occasion for this exhibit to take place!

The government has for the most part dredged it up and sold of the valuable logs, leaving mountains of driftwood here and there, piled up like the bones of mountain spirits. On the road back from Dulan, we stopped for fresh coconut juice at our favorite stand. The proprietor is handy with a machete and the juice is not too sweet, but hits the spot. Although I knew that Sophia’s dad built the pagoda at the base of Carp Mountain, I hadn’t really visited it close-up before. There were some really fun details, including the stone lions at the base. When we mentioned it to him, he insisted on driving around to look at a Taoist Temple and a Mazu Temple that he also built. We also tried to watch the sunrise - over and over again! It was easy enough to catch on the roof of our house in downtown Taitung, but more elusive at the overcast coast of Jialulan lookout point. On the other hand, we did make friends with the rare Jialulan Wildcat. He got bored with us and walked down the hill to terrorize a pack of wild dogs. When the dogs finally realized they outnumbered the wildcat they tried to chase him, but he merely jumped into a pile of wood that they couldn’t fit into and yawned. When the idea of Boston finally begins to fade away, like some sort of bad dream in a bus station, it’s reassuring to know that you can find an unattended bamboo to hide under and drink in the warm mountain air while gazing at the lump of Lu Dao (Green Island) away on the horizon. The trip just wouldn’t be complete without a thorough soaking at the Zhiben Hot Springs. It was a little misty and quite early, but still pretty mellow to gaze out from the spa at the green slopes, while getting your muscles pummeled by mad jets of hot water. Always good. It was such a short trip, really. Fortunately there is a tribal hot-line phone for some last minute chatter before boarding the Dash prop plane back to Songshan Airport. From Taipei we jumped on the High Speed Rail to Taichung. Those guys aren’t kidding! The train was pushing 300 kph on several stretches of the 50 minute ride. But they were running three minutes late by my watch, I’m telling you! I just had to catch the smooth entrance of the train to Taichung station on video…though my friendly wife likes to kibbutz my staid documentary. Anyway, we made it on time for her fancy haircut at the salon, where I was supposed to just sit around like a chunk of clay leafing through Taiwan Vogue. Fortunately I got my own scalp massage and haircut, and I even had a couple of hairs left when it was all over! But Sophia’s style was cuter, I’ll admit. In Taichung I made a new friend, Li Youwen, who I swear is the spitting image of Hunter S. Thompson. He was quite a character, and we got along really well. After a big buffet lunch, we also got together for dinner at a local outdoor seafood grill, right on the streets of Beitun. Back in Taipei we treated ourselves to the new Tsui Hark film: Tongtian shentan: Di Renjie, which is an adaption of the Judge Dee character (known in the West from Van Gulik novels). More on this great movie here! In the airport on the way home we happened to meet Master Jingzhao, who we knew from a Dharma talk that we attended at Massachusetts Buddhist Association. Master Jingzhao told me that I was pretty easy to recognize. I said: “That’s really convenient, because if I forget who I am, I can just ask someone else.” And on that Zen note, we climbed aboard the winged tin can and flew back to Boston, scooping up a neat pile of wasabi-flavored KitKat (for real!), Kanjinch? mochi, Frisk, Xylish, and other irresistible Japanese snacks at Narita Airport.","categories":[{"name":"TRAVELS","slug":"TRAVELS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/TRAVELS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"transport","slug":"transport","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/transport/"},{"name":"ecology","slug":"ecology","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/ecology/"},{"name":"vacances","slug":"vacances","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/vacances/"}]},{"title":"The Sacrifice of the Worker to the Banks","slug":"the-sacrifice-of-the-worker-to-the-banks","date":"2010-09-26T01:22:45.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T01:03:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-sacrifice-of-the-worker-to-the-banks/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-sacrifice-of-the-worker-to-the-banks/","excerpt":"Browsing through Great Drawings and Illustrations from Punch, I was quite taken by the powerful image from 1844 called: “The Game Laws; or the sacrifice of the Peasant to the Hare.” The image of a scrawny rabbit on a pedestal, glaring with new found power down at the bound peasant on his knees is eerie; while the pompous aristocrat, bearing a sword emblazoned &#8216;according to law’ is either preparing to strike off the peasant’s head or to give him clemency…his disinterest in the outcome being completely obvious.","text":"Browsing through Great Drawings and Illustrations from Punch, I was quite taken by the powerful image from 1844 called: “The Game Laws; or the sacrifice of the Peasant to the Hare.” The image of a scrawny rabbit on a pedestal, glaring with new found power down at the bound peasant on his knees is eerie; while the pompous aristocrat, bearing a sword emblazoned &#8216;according to law’ is either preparing to strike off the peasant’s head or to give him clemency…his disinterest in the outcome being completely obvious. The Game Laws (introduced in 1670) were designed to make sure that only the land-owning aristocracy had the right to hunt. This of course meant that the landless peasants, made homeless by the enclosure acts, and starved due to lack of work, were subject the cruel reality of knowing that the game they could catch and eat was forbidden to them and ran freely over hill and dale, while the privileged class sat stuffing themselves on sweetmeats in their manor houses. It seems to me a striking metaphor for the obscene disparity of wealth in America today. Since the laborers of the U.S.A. do not own land, or condos, or beach houses, or McMansions, they have little opportunity to hunt or farm for food in any form. The role of a game animal has been replaced by the ability of the worker to obtain food money. But the über-rich &#8212; with their billions in assets &#8212; grow ever richer, while the families sliding into poverty who have lost their jobs, their homes, and probably their minds, can only watch the preposterous fantasies of “winners” foisted upon them in the media. We need only to change the vengeful rabbit into an apparatchik banker in the act of foreclosing on the unfortunate worker’s home, to have our modern parallel. While that dirty business is done, the fat cat investment bankers, the brokers, and all the avaricious swine who invented and then profited from mega-bubbles of toxic derivatives and bundled ARM mortgages, swagger past with a glance at their 23-diamond movement ROLEX to see if they have time for golf before going to their feel-good charity banquet. As if they could care about those 50 million people living below the poverty line! Hmm, where’s the cajones in this society! Isn’t it time for some payback for the wretched Bushes and Cheneys and Kochs? Anyway, the artist who created the original Game Laws image was John Leech (1817-1864), who was forced to make a living as an artist when his father’s London coffee house did not succeed. He studied medicine and followed his anatomical sketches with illustrations for magazines, such as Punch. Although he died at the young age of 47, he left us some memorable images of injustice and a raft more of humorous ones; for these I send a grateful thank you to his spirit! An interesting piece on Leech can also be found in the Century Illustrated, page numbers 553-565, which is available in Google Books.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"civil rights","slug":"civil-rights","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/civil-rights/"},{"name":"tyranny","slug":"tyranny","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/tyranny/"}]},{"title":"Im Gandalf and Magneto, Get Over It","slug":"im-gandalf-and-magneto-get-over-it","date":"2010-09-23T13:49:52.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T01:18:32.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/im-gandalf-and-magneto-get-over-it/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/im-gandalf-and-magneto-get-over-it/","excerpt":"","text":"Although it is apparently a spoof made with Photoshop, I enjoyed this image of Sir Ian McKellan, who marched in London to protest the Pope.

Although there has been a torrent of speculation about the strange odyssey of “Froggy” MacIntyre, as he was known to his friends, the straight depiction of those childhood details struck me as utterly true and made me curious about his other writings. I picked up a copy of Woman Between the Worlds, which is told in a very pedestrian early 20th century tone &#8212; a style reminiscent of Arthur Conan Doyle &#8212; but which packs unexpected scenarios of pure surrealism and perhaps even psychosis. The painted enamel teeth of a partially tattooed invisible woman, which appear like the grin of the Cheshire cat, floating above her nude body that seems to be missing hands and feet and other asymmetrical parts of her anatomy! An unspeakably evil being &#8212; the Dreadful Eye &#8212; which inhabits corpses or other conglomerations of once-living organic matter, that reappears with P. K. Dickian determination to devour the souls and spirits of the living! The Dreadful Eye, attempting to drive the protagonist mad, forms mouths, eyes, ears in the flesh of the hero, traveling up and down his limbs, while speaking to him and taunting him to give up! Some of this is really strange stuff. And yet, the book is also full of amusing caricatures and jokes. The Order of the Golden Dawn, including Aleister Crowley, provide a backdrop to adventures in London, where the characters are never so exhausted from fighting off hordes of invisible fiends that they cannot deliver a ridiculous one-liner. Even as the climactic mystery of the Dreadful Eye is being explained, Froggy can’t be swayed from humor: “We came out in quite a different world; much more alien than this planet. It was the place where nightmares come from: hundreds of ‘em, all different sizes and shapes, all swarming and clawing all over one another, and all of them chattering and jabbering at the top of their voices all at once.” “I have visited that place,” said Crowley, solemnly. “You are describing the railway buffet at Clapham junction.” After chapters full of deadly fighting, and with the prospect of having to face off thousands of invisible cannibals, this sort of riposte manages to keep a strangely light-hearted spin on Froggy’s tale.

Okay, now fill up the other half of the mold using exactly the same steps one two and three, then cover the second rice ball up so that you have two mounds in both halves of the mold ready to press. step five: position the top part of the rice mold (the presser) with the convex part sticking downwards towards your rice ball mounds. line it up so that the edges will fit into the lower part as you begin to press down. with firm and even pressure, jam the top part of the mold into the bottom part, compressing your mounds of rice and ingredients together into a tight rice ball. now remove the lid and you will see the excellent rice balls just waiting to be plopped onto sheets of nori seaweed. step six: to get the really authentic Japan 7-11 style onigiri, you must obtain the pre-wrapped sheets of nori that have their own perforated pull strips. These are pretty hard to find, but H-Mart has a version. the ones shown here were brought from Taiwan by our in-law relatives (hey, thanks SO MUCH for this treat, folks). there are usually instructions and arrows printed on the outer plastic layer, showing you how to open the rice balls after they have been wrapped. you want those to appear on the outside of the rice ball, so flip the sheet over for the instructions to face down. then carefully position the first rice ball towards the top edge of the nori sheet, with a pointy end of the triangle near the top edge. now gently press the toggle in the bottom of the rice ball mold so that the rice ball slides out and falls onto the wrapper sheet. step seven: the last step is to wrap up the rice ball. start by folding the bottom half of the sheet over the top half. then fold the upper left edge of the wrapper sheet down over the left edge of the rice ball, and fold the bottom left edge of the wrapper back on top of it. repeat the same procedure for the remaining two edges on the right, and apply a small piece of tape to hold the wrapper edges together. your finished onigiri should like like a triangle wrapped in plastic. you can make them yourself, and don’t have to be at 7-11 in Japan or Taiwan, or at a special Japanese grocery store like Mitsuwa or Uwajimaya. You’re gonna love ‘em!

O’Leary said, “Hartwell grasped the contents of a story I sent him and shook them down to their basic elements, then he tossed them back at me and demanded a rewrite, along the lines of: Does the main character of this story have to be a monster, a pederast, AND a fire-breathing dragon?

Keyes wouldn’t do it and put the story aside. Then as it turned out, Keyes lived nearby the literary agent Robert Mills. They often rode the same train together commuting back and forth to the city. Supposedly, one day, as they were riding the train together Mills asked Keyes for a story and Keyes gave him Flowers for Algernon. After reading it, Mills told Keyes that he would publish it, but only if he was willing to make one important change. Assuming that Mills meant for him to change the ending, Keyes immediately starting begging Mills not to make him change the ending, anything but that! But Mills explained that he just wanted him to add a love interest, and with that resolved the story was published.” “There are other cases where the editor wants more than just changes,” Malzberg continued, “like my editor at Lancer Books. When I turned in the manuscript that I’d been contracted to write, called The Day of the Burning, he said to me &#8216;Barry, why are you handing me this shit, go home and write me a novel.’ And that just filled me with such a boiling rage, that I did go directly home just to show that him what I was made of and ending up writing The Men Inside.” Samuel R. Delany: “What makes a great editor is that he or she will get really deep inside the work to the extent that they often understand it better than the writer. Many times the piece means too much to the author on a personal level and they can’t step back and see it objectively enough to know how to change it for the better. A good editor can both understand it and have enough distance from it to say, &#8216;have you thought of changing X, Y, and Z?’ and ultimately revitalize the writer to improve the work.” Malzberg: “Another editor who deserves to be mentioned is Ben Bova. Considering that he was working as the editor of Analog right after the long run of John Campbell, he was able to make stories that never would have fit into Campbell’s paradigm feel like they were still Analog stories. Bova had this peculiar and strange power to publish some really unusual stories and still make them seem to the readers like Analog stories. And Bova got practically no credit for holding out through the interegnum between Campbell and the endless sleep of Stanley Schmidt that followed.” (laughter) van Gelder: “Of course, you can’t forget Terry Carr. In the Encyclopedia of SF, Carr said himself that his greatest contribution to the field was to commission various authors to write novels besed on short stories.” Malzberg: “On the subject of getting more out the author, there’s the case of Harry Harrison. He sent the original Deathworld story to John Campbell, who returned it with the comment, &#8216;interesting, let’s see more.” Three times Harrison sent in new and longer versions, and each time Campbell would send it back, saying &#8216;intersting, more!’ Finally, the fourth time Campbell accepted it and that became Harry Harrison’s first published novel. It enabled him to escape New York and become a writer. As for Terry Carr, he was amazing. His career spanned decades of series and Ace Specials, and in those Ace Specials he put out Left Hand of Darkness in 1968, and Neuromancer in 1982. That’s an incredible record. Of course, John Campbell was at Astounding &amp; Analog for thirty-three years. Well, let’s face it, he stayed much too long.” Delany: “Then you had a newcomer like Michael Moorcock, who came in at 25 years old to take over New Worlds. He was a kid, really, and when you think of the impact of New Worlds we’re still talking about those stories and the whole New Wave today. With that Arts Council grant, he brought in a whole group of talented writers, including the sort of material that you can’t imagine getting published anywhere else at the time, including highlights by authors like Ballard, M. John Harrison, Bayley, Spinrad, Tom Disch…” van Gelder: “At the time, Charles Platt figured that it would be a bright burst of light, but wouldn’t last.” Malzberg: “Sure, Moorcock knew that the party wouldn’t last and he’d be moving on to something else. But the resulting explosion was like that old joke about the Velvet Underground in the 60s, even though they only had 1,000 listeners themselves all thousand of them started their own bands…”","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"},{"name":"editing","slug":"editing","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/editing/"}]},{"title":"Readercon 21, another feast for the mind","slug":"readercon-21-another-feast-for-the-mind","date":"2010-07-17T17:48:30.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/readercon-21-another-feast-for-the-mind/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/readercon-21-another-feast-for-the-mind/","excerpt":"Great fun at this year’s Readercon 2010, which left me with plenty of food for thought!

On the other hand, I was pleased as punch when Schweitzer sold me a used copy of Harry Warner Jr.s All Our Yesterdays for a five-spot. Yes, I’m a sucker for fan history. As readers of Yunchtime didn’t already know that! Moving on to the panels, my participation was slightly spotty, because this year I signed up as a volunteer for several sessions. In addition to the gratifying feeling of helping out the con, I met Bob Colby, the fearless founder of Readercon! Hope to catch up with him at a punk rock bar one of these days. Following are some panel highlights transcribed from my hand-written notes. Lost Worlds of A. A. Merritt The panel reminisced about which of Merritt’s books they encountered first, and what struck them most about his style. The consensus was that Merritt’s books transported the reader to lost worlds and visited lost races by means of a rich, wordy, poetic prose. Like Joseph Conrad, Merritt lavished colorful details into the descriptions, for all of our senses. Merritt evoked smells, tastes, sounds and textures that are less common today, when the prose tends to be terse, and plot-driven. This sort of other-worldly fantasy atmosphere permeates Merritt’s novels, and greatly appealed to certain readers. Elizabeth Hand said that Hannes Bok loved the Ship of Ishtar so much that he copied out the entire book in longhand. She also said that readers were not as jaded in the early part of the 20th Century, pointing out that when the Moon Pool was published in 1918, readers flooded All-Story Weekly with letters wanting to know if the story was “true?” Could such a place, a lost world, exist on some remote island in the South Pacific? This trope continues to fascinate, considering the trail of King Kong films that have been made since that time, to such an extent that the fantastic island has been rarified into a of Platonic form in the popular culture: witness the success of J. J. Abrams “Lost” series. Jack Haringa: “Because imagined worlds today are manifested for us in film, in three-dimensional immersive technologies, readers are not as attracted to such rich language that laboriously constructs imagery for all the senses. “Words” were the CGI of yesteryear.” Haringa provided some more background, “Merritt made tons of money, both from his novels and from his work as an editor for Hearst publications. He was notable in the publishing field and was, after all, the first fantasy author to have a magazine named after him. In the years after he became wealthy, he traveled far and wide to the sort of romantic places that served as inspiration for his lost worlds fiction… places like Tibet, India, Africa. But here’s another interesting anecdote: early in his career, when he was working as a reporter for the Hearst newspapers, he witnessed something in Philadelphia. I’m not sure what he witnessed, but as a consequence he was sent (by some unknown agency) to South America for several years. Apparently that early experience in South America strongly influenced his writings, too, and this was before he was wealthy enough to travel the world on his own dime.” “Despite the otherworldly aspects of his writing,” Haringa said, “in Merritt’s writing there is a conscious connection between the characters and the lost worlds. For example, at the beginning of the Moon Pool, the island of Panape is a living force which speaks to the protagonist, in effect telling him that &#8216;I will tolerate your presence here, but for how long?’ As if the island, and by extension the Earth, is a reluctant host for the plague of humanity.”","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"}]},{"title":"Science Fiction Art Editors","slug":"science-fiction-art-editors","date":"2010-05-15T18:12:27.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/science-fiction-art-editors/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/science-fiction-art-editors/","excerpt":"","text":"Here’s a new resource to augment the Science Fiction Artists Database: the first version of a mind map about Art Editors who worked for Science Fiction Magazines and Book Publishers.

Not only for his use of a word like “stereotaxically” but also for his crazy hypothesis that amplified currents connecting the brains of two chickens is a suitable proxy for telepathy. I’m quite willing to accept the existence of telepathy, but it has nothing to do with electrodes implanted into anything’s brain…that’s the sort of invasive procedure that psi powers need to avoid, if you ask me. Even more fascinating was to discover that the chicken-brain experimenter is none other than Erich von Holst, the pioneer of ornithopters!

In Ochagavia’s painting (below the fold), what a fantastic and amusingly surreal dragon the anonymous hero is fighting! Unlike most dragons &#8212; that belch shafts of castle-rending fire &#8212; this dragon seems to have a big strawberry for a tongue, and merely emits some flash-beams of white light from its eyeballs, while lazily flipping a tail that looks something like an octopus tentacle on a railroad track. The dragon’s pose is no more menacing than a self-hypnotized tabby cat sitting on the sofa, and his goofy whiskers could easily pass for those of an old catfish. The gorgeously rendered background evokes medieval and Flemish masters, with a Boschian eggshell sitting majestically behind an old cairn and a lush, mist-filled forest. As if this brilliant scene was not enough, Ochagavia has rendered it all AGAIN in miniature, on the screen of a laboratory, which itself is painted with soft, silvery, inner-spherical perspective. Surely the original painting of this still exists somewhere! How I would like to see it someday!

After some further inquiries it was found that all of the circumstances described in the open letter actually happened.&#160; The current director of Zongheng Net (Chinese Literature website), nicknamed “Shuoshuren,” was formerly an editor on the staff of Science Fiction World.&#160; Yesterday, when interviewed, he revealed that the situation at Science Fiction World is dire, and that the circulation as fallen by 20,000 back to the level it was at 10 years ago.&#160; “The boss became such a cheapskate that it’s now impossible for the editorial department to treat the authors fairly even though they want to.&#160; And I’ve also heard that recently Science Fiction World abolished a number of internal management regulations.” Of course, it is also possible that the current explosion of the editorial collective is due to disagreements over pay.&#160; According to our findings, under the management of previous editor-in-chiefs, compensation for editors was linked to performance, with some editors being able to earn a few thousand RMB per month.&#160; But since Li Chang took over, the link to performance was abolished and even as the tasks such as writing stories, translation, and illustration were added onto their other editorial duties, pay was capped at 1000 RMB per month. In comparison to the outrage of the editors, the magazine’s readers are clearly more concerned about the quality problems of Science Fiction World.&#160; One reader, Ms. Zhu, responded that compared to a few years ago Science Fiction World is getting worse and worse.&#160; “Some of the frequently seen famous writers from before are absent, while the quality of new works by some unknown writers is not remarkable at all, and seems more like pseudo-science farce. It’s all very disappointing.” Yesterday we managed to contact a long-running author in the pages of Science Fiction World who wished to remain anonymous.&#160; That author told us that it had already been many months since he had any requests for stories from the magazine, and when he tried to call the editors himself, they stalled for time as if they were hiding something.&#160; “When I looked at the recent issues of the magazine, it seemed that some of their stories are really questionable, with some basic points that are obviously unscientific, and which could really mislead the readers.&#160; I don’t want to give you my name now, just in case the magazine asks me for a manuscript, because I’m still willing to write for them.” &gt; UPDATE:&#160; Li Chang Booted Out of Office &gt; Source article See also:&#160; Big-name authors back rebellion at Chinese sci-fi magazine and:&#160; Magazine Editor Under Fire and Danwei Article Note:&#160; some sources in Chinese use the figure of 200,000 drop in circulation (ershi wan), not 20,000 (er wan) as written in the CCTV article.&#160; I’m assuming that the lower figure is correct.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"editing","slug":"editing","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/editing/"}]},{"title":"Robot fetishism and the antibody syndrome","slug":"robot-fetishism-and-the-antibody-syndrome","date":"2010-03-23T16:29:01.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"MACHINES/robot-fetishism-and-the-antibody-syndrome/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/MACHINES/robot-fetishism-and-the-antibody-syndrome/","excerpt":"Because I never watch television or read magazines,&#160; I am quite slow to notice emerging trends in pop culture.&#160; That is why a had such a shock this weekend when we were driving on a highway ramp towards the airport and a gigantic billboard loomed over me, asking in texting language: “R U Bot or Not?”","text":"Because I never watch television or read magazines,&#160; I am quite slow to notice emerging trends in pop culture.&#160; That is why a had such a shock this weekend when we were driving on a highway ramp towards the airport and a gigantic billboard loomed over me, asking in texting language: “R U Bot or Not?” This seems innocuous enough, in an age when humanity dreams of the singularity and yearns for artificial bodies to escape from the ugly realities of biological existence.&#160;&#160; All the more mundane, perhaps, when men start to marry anime characters, sex robots, and pillows, rather than try their luck with real human companions.&#160; Should I even be shocked? But it just so happens that the very same day, I had finished reading David J. Skal’s _Antibodies_, a book that deals with a cult of self-destructive full transhumanist transplants.&#160;&#160; As only Skal can, he weaves a hypnotic and disturbing tale around the people who would shed their biological “meat bodies” in exchange for synthetic prothesis, and the others in society who would supposedly “heal” them from their obsession.&#160;&#160; There is nothing quite as terrifying as the perfect prose of David J. Skal when he is on a roll (see, for example, his debut novel _Scavengers_, which is a very twisted book indeed); and it was just after the horrifying conclusion of Antibodies that I encountered the R U Bot or Not Billboard.&#160;&#160; It sent shivers up my spine! By the way, the Vincent DiFate cover for the paperback original of Antibodies is spot on for the story! Even worse, when I looked around for the origin of that poster I soon discovered the entire ad campaign of Svedka Vodka, which is selling their rotgut with the imagery of sexy female robots.&#160;&#160; Svedka spells out the process for those who might be a little lame-brained, by providing an interactive, “bot builder,” where their target audience (horny males with a thing for compliant robots?) can design their own fem bot.&#160;&#160; According to the ad:&#160; “Build your very own party bot.&#160; The Svedka Bot Builder will create your perfect silicone clone, ready and willing to serve.” It’s hard to begin to describe how creepy this ad campaign is, going beyond the objectification of women to the imaginary design and construction of synthetic sex partners.&#160;&#160; Nothing new about this, as the scribblings on any Junior High school desk will demonstrate…but as a global advertising campaign to sell Vodka?","categories":[{"name":"MACHINES","slug":"MACHINES","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/MACHINES/"}],"tags":[{"name":"social mores","slug":"social-mores","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/social-mores/"},{"name":"robotics","slug":"robotics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/robotics/"},{"name":"booze","slug":"booze","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/booze/"}]},{"title":"Charles Moore  -  The Right Stuff","slug":"charles-moore-the-right-stuff","date":"2010-03-18T14:37:21.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/charles-moore-the-right-stuff/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/charles-moore-the-right-stuff/","excerpt":"","text":"Born in Alabama, the photographer Charles Moore closely followed the civil rights movement with his camera and an open mind.

Right after that they had a brief exchange on a psychological study of SF writers: *** Fred Pohl: Some years ago two psychologists decided they wanted to find out what science fiction writers were like. They sent out a questionnaire to a bunch of science fiction writers and asked them to answer the sort of questions you get on psychological testing papers. How do you feel about your mother and this and that. And from these they prepared a group psychological profile of science fiction writers. They compared it with a similar group profile for some other kind of writers and for a third group of people. They found out that the science fiction writers were in many ways similar to most human beings! There were a couple of differences, and one was in what is called “aggressive” versus “withdrawn” cyclothymia. Alfred Bester: What is cyclothymia? Fred Pohl: It’s a kind of lunacy. But the question was not whether you had it, but if you had it which way you would go. Withdrawn cyclothymic people are more or less passive and tend to let things go, and overlook something that is wrong. The people who tend the other way are stubborn and won’t take nothing from nobody, and have their own opinions which you’re not going to change with an axe! And science fiction writers were like that – the stubbornest, most difficult human beings alive! *** This dialog reminded me of a joke piece that I wrote for CusFussing in 1979 called Science Fiction Brains. You can see the published illustration for that article above. I distinctly remember drawing it on a scrap of greenish colored bond paper that I found somebody’s office in Phoenix that summer. But never before published is a related sketch (complete with characteristic coffee stain), and an explanation of the “lobes of the brain,” which was probably the idea behind the story if the first place. Somehow the explanation of the lobes got lost in both the inked version of the sketch and the story. But here it is, for posterity.","categories":[{"name":"HUMAN BEINGS","slug":"HUMAN-BEINGS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/HUMAN-BEINGS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"psychology","slug":"psychology","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/psychology/"},{"name":"humor","slug":"humor","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/humor/"},{"name":"brains","slug":"brains","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/brains/"}]},{"title":"You lose track of time...","slug":"you-lose-track-of-time","date":"2010-02-12T01:08:35.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/you-lose-track-of-time/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/you-lose-track-of-time/","excerpt":"","text":"Yes, it’s been a strange week!

Allen Steele, said that today is probably the absolutely worst time ever to enter the market as a new author: the markets are drying up for short fiction, and competition for novel slots at the publishing houses is fierce. Then, perhaps just to contradict himself, a few minutes later he said that “in some ways new writers might have the advantage of novelty, because at least the editors are ambitious enough to want to find the next Neil Gaiman. But the established writer, with fifteen novels under their belt, is already pigeon-holed and has lost the novelty appeal.” Joy Marchand, who has edited for Shimmer Magazine (speculative fiction for a miscreant world) said that the small publishers will actually sift through the mountain of rejects from major publishers, looking for that one story that could be fabulous. “One the other hand, it’s true that you should start at the top &#8212; the best publisher in the field &#8212; then work your way down. You’ll find that there’s definitely a tier system of editorial engagement,” said Marchand, “at the top, where the majors are only interested in sales track records, you’ll get an immediate no thank you letter. In the middle, you might get a sale, but on the condition of some changes, so at least you know that your submission got read. At the bottom of the food chain, with the independent publishers and zines, you can find an editor who is willing to help you build a story up into a publishable form.” Remembering his first story sold to Asimov’s SF, Steele said, “When Gardner told me he would buy &#8216;Live from Mars Hotel,’ he wanted me to cut it down from 30 pages to 20 pages. At first it seemed like a real chore to chop one third of the whole narrative out, but as I went through it, I realized that I could really boil it down into the core of the story. So his input helped me in the long run. Whether you’re a novice or a pro, you should have a friendly relationship with your editor. It’s not an arm-wrestling match. So don’t focus so much on what the editor says and keep in mind that you’re writing to the audience of the magazine, not to the editor.” “And when the editor does ask for changes,” Dozois added, “don’t automatically accept them. It’s your story, and if the editor tells you to change a certain character into a pony, but you really don’t want to do that, then sell it somewhere else.” Nurenberg said that working for White Wolf, he would get tips from the editors about ways in which he needed to keep his story in line with the established characters owned by the house. “Sometimes I’d get a little warning, reminding me that in the White Wolf universe, vampires can’t sparkle.” And then there are cases where you have to put your foot down and fight, said Steele. “My book, Coyote, was written as series of stories for Asimov’s. Each story was told from a different character’s viewpoint, and the novel version was a sort of mosaic made up of these very different narrators. One of them is written in the first person, and the narrator is a teenage girl. The editor insisted that I change her character to a teenage boy. But I just refused to do that, because a big part of the story hinged on the narrator as being a pregnant teenage girl.” “It’s not such a big deal, after all a pregnant teenage boy ought to be just another wrinkle in an SF story,” jibed Dozois. Going on to discuss the attitudes of editors at the big publishers, Dozois said, “these houses have huge slush piles that nobody reads, not even the assistants who are paid to read through them. When people tell me they’ve had their book read and rejected by all the publishers in town, the fact is that the manuscript has only visited all the mail rooms of those publishers, and never got anywhere near an editor’s desk. It’s gotten to the point where publishers will set up a room at a convention and hold pitch sessions, were authors are given a maximum of three minutes to sell their idea. If it’s accepted, they are given a special card with an address to send their manuscript which will bypass the slush pile and get to someone who will read it… otherwise, they are just shown the door.” Joy Marchand admitted to working the door for one of the pitch sessions at a recent Horror convention. “Those miserable authors were literally shaking and trembling in their boots.” “That’s why you’ve got to try to meet editors at some social function, like a convention,” advised Dozois. “If you can manage to introduce yourself, without slavishly kissing their ass, making an acquaintance with an editor will really increase your chances of getting your story read.” “Actually,” admitted Steele, “that’s how I sold that first story to Gardner here. I was at a Boskone talking with a friend and she saw you across the room and suddenly dragged me over to meet you. &#8216;This is the author Allen Steele,’ she said, even though I had barely been published at that time. And Gardner shook my hand, said &#8216;Nice to meet you,” and just walked immediately away. I turned to my friend and said, &#8216;What the hell was that all about?’ and she told me flat out: &#8216;I want you to go home and write the very best damn story you can and send it straight away to Dozois.’ That’s what I ended up doing and it turned out to be the first story I sold to Asimov’s. So, just even that brief introduction makes a difference.” “Networking at social gatherings is one thing,” said Marchand, “but you also have to participate in workshops, meet other writers, and join online writer’s groups where you can find out which editor is buying which material, for instance.” “Some people think of networking as an evil expedient,” said Cavelos, “but it’s really more about making friends with mutual interests. You can find out from each other about new markets, trends, and possible openings. Opportunities always appear at moments of change. So if you notice that an editor has been promoted, or switched jobs, they are usually hungry for some new authors at that point in their career. If you can keep tabs on that information by reading Locus and through your networks it will really help. Keep in mind that you’ve got to give the editor a good enough story for them to fall in love with it. In most cases you’ll find that if the editor is asking for changes that they are pointing to a weakness in the story. Maybe you totally disagree about changing the character to a pony, but you should try to figure out what the problems were from the editor’s point of view and how you can fix it. If you can learn that special skill, of how to work through these problems with an editor, it will be valuable for your whole career.”","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"editing","slug":"editing","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/editing/"},{"name":"writing","slug":"writing","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/writing/"}]},{"title":"Arisia 2010 con report: Barefoot Techno-Fantasy Fest, in a Kilt","slug":"arisia-2010-barefoot-techno-fantasy-fest-in-a-kilt","date":"2010-01-20T01:23:00.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/arisia-2010-barefoot-techno-fantasy-fest-in-a-kilt/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/arisia-2010-barefoot-techno-fantasy-fest-in-a-kilt/","excerpt":"[photo by Sean Molloy] At my first Arisia, I found myself weaving through crowds of strangely-coiffed pirates, rocketeers, and gamers; wondering at what point my own personality would intersect with one of those cliques and, at the same time, idly speculating as to which clique it would be.

You could say that it was the same rich stew of individuals at Arisia 2010, but there were definitely higher concentrations of bare feet, of blood-drenched nurses, blue-green body paint (though only a few of them Navi, as fas as I could tell), and really pervasive wearing of kilts. Sure, some people I expect to see wearing a kilt (since that’s pretty common around the office…okay, it is Cambridge!), but it seemed like every time I turned around there was another utilikilt wrapped around some smiling, bearded dude. Which means that this year’s Arisia (officially sub-titled “the future and the past”) has been informally dubbed by Yunchtime as the “barefoot techno-fantasy fest, in a kilt.” [masquerade photo by Batwrangler ] The first session I attended was Costume Tech, which appears once every several years, and introduces all the amazing lighting, audio, video, and staging of the famous masquerade. The presentations did not go into specific types of gear or software applications, but rather provided some tips and procedures that come in handy for running such a large scale production. For anyone who hasn’t witnessed the Arisia masquerade, you have to picture the mind-boggling problem of walking into a gigantic empty and echoing ballroom that has to be transformed into a major stage production, including the assembly and testing of not only the stage itself, but 20-ft high lighting racks, four live video camera feeds, wireless and wired sound systems, intercom for crew communication, footlights, a 30-ft wide cyclorama background screen, and all the comcomitant cables, amplifiers, multi-channel mixing boards, and their fanatically devoted human handlers who actually get it all to work! This was a truly fun and educational session, complete with a neat 8 page handout. It inspired me to grab Hobbit in a hallway later on and ask him about the WholeHog. I’ve been told: what transpires in Thomas Paine, stays in Thomas Paine… But, if you really need to know, word on the street is that secret testing has emerged from the Colors and Lights laboratory and some innocent guinea pigs were spotted around a strange new gameboard amidst the general tumult at Arisia 2010. Maybe in 2011 we’re going to see a cool game launch! But it’s just a rumor… At the Science Fiction / Science Fact panel, experts delved into the ways in which sfnal ideas manifested themselves in the real world. Obvious examples are: Star Trek Communicator -&gt; cell phone… voice-activated devices - &gt; speech recognition… robots -&gt; robots… flying car -&gt; in Boston, we don’t go there! On the theme of robots, Mark Amidon (of iRobot) explained why military research is often driving innovations on the sfnal edge. “For industrial products, you have to pay in advance for all your own R&amp;D, and only after you actually have a useful product can you begin to sell it and try to recoup your investment. On the other hand, the Dept of Defense is going to pay for everything up front, as long as you can demonstrate that your research is moving towards supplying them with a cost-effective solution. For example, if you have guys getting shot up at the point of engagement, you want to get them out of there and put robots in the line of fire. Now if you were developing a commercial product line of robots, it would take forever to make enough money to offer a product that could handle those conditions, but all the military wants is cost-effectiveness: will it take the first round of enemy fire? If the answer is yes, they’ll pay for the research, testing, and production.” Alan Wexelblat (MIT Media Lab grad, who “knows next to nothing about everything”) was fascinated by the ways in which robots have been adopted into the societies of Japan and Korea. There, unlike in the U.S., robots are being widely used for home care of the elderly. Those robots, though they are far from AI, have a sort of two-stage intelligence. “In the first stage the robot behaves according to some preset patterns, such as asking if medication has been taken, or if they detect sudden motion, like a person slipping or falling down, they are able to react by asking if help is needed. But the really interesting thing is that the robot is able to make a judgement about when it’s own pre-programmed behavior is not adequate, at which point the robot’s screen will turn itself off and be replaced by a live video-call connection to an actual human nurse. In the U.S. we’re a long way from having that sort of interaction with our robots.” That doesn’t mean that people don’t get attached to their Roombas! Avidon retold the story about the bomb-detection robot, nicknamed by its human handlers “Scooby Doo,” that was destroyed during operations in Iraq. The soldiers were so emotionally attached to the device, that contravening all procedures when Scooby Doo was blown up, one of the men ran directly into the danger zone, swept up the pieces of the robot and ran them back to the shop, where he asked “can you fix him?” “This just took us completely by surprise,” said Avidon, “because we had no idea how involved these people would become with their machines. We had users writing us to ask: where do I enter the name of my robot? because we can’t find it in the manual… The name? We never thought that these bomb units were going to need a name programmed into them!” On the topic of neuro-informatics, the science that combines the analysis of how our brains work with computational models, Will Howitt said that we are not going to upload our brains into a computer anytime soon. Taking full cochlear implants as a point of comparison, Howitt said that the number of nerve connections needed to succeed in replacing a human ear is something that we can already achieve with limited results. But the entire central nervous system is so many orders of magnitude more complex, that mapping those connections to simulation models is something that we may never achieve. In terms of what SF gets right and wrong about predicting the future, Wexelbatt remarked “SF can be really good at anticipating new technology, but awfully bad at describing social changes caused by new technologies. There were any number of SF stories that used the concept of the Internet as a communication device for scientific and military applications, but how many described it in terms of our ten-year old daughter organizing her slumber party on Facebook?” The only film I watched on Saturday was a strange documentary short, “Life on Other Worlds,” from 1961. This must be something that Scott Dorsey dug up from NASA or the National Archives. The only info I could find out about this film was on the history page of KUHT, America’s oldest Public Television Station. According to that source, “Life on Other Worlds” was the last episode of “Doctors in Space,” a 13-part look at aviation medicine centered around the School of Aviation Medicine at San Antonio’s Randolph Air Force Base. The 22 minute film did not look like it was shot in Texas, though…it took place in some gigantic ballroom, probably in New York City, and the announcer mentioned something about thanks to Seagram’s, no doubt the sponsor of the Doctors in Space series. Irony? Rotgut whiskey pays for space medicine? Oh, glory be, what a nice concept! In the ballroom were hundreds of guests, the majority of them men, and each of those men was industriously puffing or chomping on either a cigaret or a cigar. Facing the audience on stage left was a panel of journalists: Walter Cronkite, Chet Huntley, and the science correspondent of the New York Times. Chet Huntley was obviously the major in those days, he had all the face time on camera, and sat there looking serious and sad, smoking butts, and squinting from some serious bags under his eyes. In order to be a respected journo in those days you really had to drink a gallon of whiskey per day, smoke ten packs of Pall Malls, and only get 15 minutes of sleep in a cab between the Algonquin Club and a Remington typewriter. And you could read it all in Huntley’s eyes, that poor bastard! The panel of scientists included Arnold Toynbee, Harlow Shapley, and several other dignitaries of chemistry, sociology, and astronomy. After giving opening statements on the number of stars in the known Universe and the likelihood of finding planets that can sustain life on them, the scientists took questions from the journalists. The interesting thing about watching this film 50 years later, is to realize how similar in many respects the informed viewpoint of extra-terrestrial life was to our own. Shapley had previously said, “In the beginning was the Word, and I might venture that the word was hydrogen gas,” which made him a villain to some Creationists, but was quite consistent with his view that by every indication naturally evolved life forms did, and still do, exist on other planets. As for Venus and Mars, Shapley and his fellow scientists remarked on the extreme heat and cold of those planets, and made predictions about what we would find on those worlds that is remarkably consistent with all the facts that we have subsequently discovered. When Huntley asked the scientists what question they would ask an alien intelligence, if and when humans did establish radio signal contact with them, the sociologist replied, “ I would ask them: what do you want to know about us?” This gave me pause to consider &#8212; probably it’s very true that you’d have to be totally alien and light years away with absolutely no previous experience of the human race in order to actually WANT to know anything about us… Finally, I should note Toynbee’s concluding remark, “We should be trying to make contact with the spiritual worlds in ourselves first, rather than physical worlds in the external Universe,” which sounds a heck of a lot like the objective behind New Wave of SF occurring at roughly the same time. Altogether this was a fine gem of an old newsreel, and I’ve spent some extra wordage on it because it simply doesn’t exist on Youtube. At the Art Show this year was a fine selection of GOH Sarah Clemens works, and some very intricate architectural maze-like drawings by Yossi Vesseid. But the highlight, in my opinion, was a hilarious print of a drawing by Frank Wu, called Lincoln on the Moon, featuring a zombie green-faced analog of the 16th President sporting a Confederate flag (!) on his space-suit, while his small steampunk rocketship sits in the moonscape behind him, and a burning earth hangs in a purple sky. Just a crazy and fun image, to be sure! Frank Wu also participated in the dueling easels event, alongside E. J. Dionne and Matt Ryan. Sharpie pens blazing, and fans in the audience heckling, the three artists sketched up a storm in (fairly loose) relation to passages read from several SF and Fantasy books. E. J. Dionne’s sketches appeared in a fanciful, curvy style, and included a pretty neat floating skull with red eyeball dripping out and wearing a studded medieval cap. Frank Wu’s whiz-bang sketches featured such oddities as giant insects flying a spaceship wearing steampunk boots and goggles…but those details really appear in Welle’s First Men in The Moon, insisted Wu, “I didn’t make the shit up!” Matt Ryan’s speed sketching was just awesome. Check out his version of the woman in the dungeon with the floating skull. Also on the theme of art, Frank Wu presented an updated version of the animation trailer for Guidolon, Giant Space Chicken, at the Kaiju session. Guidolon, you must understand is from Guido, the character in Fellini’s film, 8 1/2, in which Fellini is making a film about Guido, who is making a film about making film. Therefore, it is easy to understand why Guidolon, the Giant Space Chicken from Tokyo (circa 1977…the future Tokyo 1977), is a giant kaiju monster that is trying to make a movie about giant kaiju monsters. Frank Wu has the whole rationale of this hilarious movie-in-the-making down pat: “We are all suspended in existential angst between the giant powerful creatures that we wish we really were, and the chicken that we really are. Hanging in that amorphous space, is where we find out if we can truly define ourselves or if others will define us.” I guess you could say that Guidolon is sort of a cross between Superchicken and Spiderman, on goofballs, as made by Toho Studios. So, if any of you zillionaire producers out there are wondering which animation project you want to see on the big screen, then jet your browsers on over to Guidolon and let’s get that Space Chicken onto the big screen! Did I mention that it’s a Giant Kaiju Space Chicken? With existential angst? What are you waiting for! Where the heck do we go from here? Keep tuned for another post on Gardner Dozois, the Arisia 2010 GOH, and on the future of small press SF publishing.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"arisia","slug":"arisia","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/arisia/"}]},{"title":"Get Used to it, Lady...","slug":"get-used-to-it-lady","date":"2010-01-04T04:26:29.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/get-used-to-it-lady/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/get-used-to-it-lady/","excerpt":"","text":"Happy New Year, and welcome to the same old story… At least in the comic pages sixty years ago, the standards of line art were fantastic, such as the panel above in Alex Raymond’s Rip Kirby.

(Of course, you could do the same to obtain Drupal core, if you want.) Each Drupal site would live in its own folder below the webroot, while the actual core installation and multisites existed above the webroot in an area secure from casual intruders. (You can also get all the following notes in a PDF file here) On Centos 5.3, the file system would look something like this: /var/www/drupal /var/www/siteOne /var/www/siteTwo and where the webroot is at /var/www/html and the URL of the example is: www.wottsamotta.edu Fortunately, Justin Hileman figured out the hard part, involving the establishment of symlinks from each of the multisites back to the core install of Drupal. I’ve integrated his instructions into my own step-by-step case, as follows: [Note: these instructions assume you are logged in to Linux / Centos 5.3 as root or super-user, and that you have already set up an instance of mySQL with the database called “db1” username “natasha” and password “boris”] 1 Get the latest Drupal core and untar it somewhere, like /home/rocky/ 1.1 cd /home/rocky/ 1.2 tar -xzvf drupal-6.15.tar.gz 2 Create the folder where your Drupal core will live, then move the Drupal libraries there 2.1 cd /var/www 2.2 mkdir drupal 2.3 cp -R /home/rocky/drupal-6.15/* /var/www/drupal 3 Create the modules folder with CVS and grab some contrib modules (here only showing example Admin_Menu module) 3.1 cd /var/www/drupal/sites/all 3.2 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal-contrib checkout -d modules -l contributions/modules 3.3 cd /var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules 3.4 cvs -d:pserver:anonymous:anonymous@cvs.drupal.org:/cvs/drupal-contrib checkout -d admin_menu -r DRUPAL-6 - 1-5 contributions/modules/admin_menu 4 Create the first multisite folder under Drupal core /sites/ (note, use all dots in the folder name, as described), the example here is a multisite called “siteOne,” which will eventually be reached by the URL: www.wottsamotta.edu/siteOne/ 4.1 mkdir /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 4.2 cd /var/www/drupal/sites/ 4.3 chown apache www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 4.4 chmod a+x www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 4.5 chmod o+w www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 5 Now Create the multisite folder itself (where any site specific settings, scripts, templates, etc will live) and sub-folders that will become the means to connect this multisite back to the Drupal core (this will make more sense later when adding the symlinks) 5.1 mkdir /var/www/siteOne 5.2 mkdir /var/www/siteOne/sites 5.3 mkdir /var/www/siteOne/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 5.4 cd /var/www/siteOne/sites/ 5.5 chown apache www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 5.6 chmod a+x www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 5.7 chmod o+w www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne 6 Copy the settings.php from Drupal core to the new multisite, where specific prefixes can be set to distinguish its own tables from any other multisite. (Note, another option is to set up shared users, profiles, etc among the multisites… But that’s not covered here.) (Note: the filename is changed from default_settings.php to settings.php, and it lives in the root folder of www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/, not in www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/sites/default/ which doesn’t need to exist ) 6.1 cp /var/www/drupal/sites/default/default.settings.php /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/settings.php 7 Edit the settings.php for siteOne to reflect the database connections and a unique prefix, which will create completely separate set of tables for siteOne (in this examples all the tables will be preceded by “s1_”) 7.1 cd /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/ 7.2 vi settings.php 7.3 [edit to your rqmts] $db_url = &#8216;mysql://natasha:boris@localhost/db1’; $db_prefix = &#8216;s1_‘; 8 Create some symlinks from siteOne component folders to the Drupal core folders (if you see any blinking symlinks, they didn’t work!) 8.1 cd /var/www (this shouldn’t matter, but it makes sense to create symlinks from a root folder) 8.2 ln -s /var/www/drupal/misc siteOne/misc 8.3 ln -s /var/www/drupal/modules siteOne/modules 8.4 ln -s /var/www/drupal/themes siteOne/themes 8.5 ln -s /var/www/drupal/includes siteOne/includes 8.6 ln -s /var/www/drupal/sites/all siteOne/sites/all 9 Create a symlink from siteOne /files folder to non-existent /files folder under /drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne (naturally this symlink will appear to be broken, &amp; blinking, but it will work AFTER the drupal install.php script is run… so no worries!) 9.1 ln -s /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/files/ siteOne/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/files 10 Create a set of .php files that will include the core drupal files when HTTP requests them from siteOne (you can use vi to create each file then paste in the following contents), note that the files should be created in /var/www/siteOne/ 10.1 vi index.php &lt;?php chdir(&#8216;/var/www/drupal/‘); include(&#8216;./index.php’); ?&gt; 10.2 vi install.php &lt;?php chdir(&#8216;/var/www/drupal/‘); include(&#8216;./install.php’); ?&gt; 10.3 vi update.php &lt;?php chdir(&#8216;/var/www/drupal/‘); include(&#8216;./update.php’); ?&gt; 10.4 vi cron.php &lt;?php chdir(&#8216;/var/www/drupal/‘); include(&#8216;./cron.php’); ?&gt; 10.5 vi xmlrpc.php &lt;?php chdir(&#8216;/var/www/drupal/‘); include(&#8216;./xmlrpc.php’); ?&gt; 10.6 you should now have the following files under siteOne/ folder: index.php, install.php, update.php, cron.php, xmlrpc.php 11 Finally create the symlink that will send real HTTP requests to siteOne/ and by proxy to drupal/ from the URL: www.wottsamotta.edu/siteOne 11.1 cd /var/www 11.2 ln -s /var/www/siteOne /var/www/html/siteOne 12 Install the first multisite called siteOne by running the install.php script (note, if you try to list contents of folder itself nothing will happen) 12.1 point your browser at: www.wottsamotta.edu/siteOne/install.php 13 you will be prompted to enter your site info and admin password. (if there were any hangups with permissions on /files folders, try chmod 777 as in steps 4.5 and 5.7 above… but change it back to chmod 755, then chmod o+w afterwards) 14 your first multsite should now be running! if you check mySQL database, the tables should all be preceded by the prefix that you added in step 7.3, like “s1_actions”. best to hide or delete the install.php script 14.1 cd /var/www/siteOne 14.2 mv install.php DoneThat_install.php 15 now you can install the next multsite, for this example, called siteTwo. 15.1 mkdir /var/www/siteTwo 15.2 mkdir /var/www/siteTwo/sites 15.3 mkdir /var/www/siteTwo/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 15.4 cd /var/www/siteTwo/sites/ 15.5 chown apache www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 15.6 chmod a+x www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 15.7 chmod o+w www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 16 add the siteTwo profile to the drupal/sites folder 16.1 mkdir /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 16.2 cd /var/www/drupal/sites/ 16.3 chown apache www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 16.4 chmod a+x www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 16.5 chmod o+w www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo 17 copy the settings.php from siteOne and edit it to reflect the unique table prefix needed for siteTwo (in this example “s2_”) 17.1 cp /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteOne/settings.php /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo/settings.php 17.2 vi settings.php 17.3 [edit to your rqmts] $db_url = &#8216;mysql://natasha:boris@localhost/db1’; $db_prefix = &#8216;s2_‘; 18 Create some symlinks from siteTwo component folders to the Drupal core folders (if you see any blinking symlinks, they didn’t work!) 18.1 cd /var/www (this shouldn’t matter, but it makes sense to create symlinks from a root folder) 18.2 ln -s /var/www/drupal/misc siteTwo/misc 18.3 ln -s /var/www/drupal/modules siteTwo/modules 18.4 ln -s /var/www/drupal/themes siteTwo/themes 18.5 ln -s /var/www/drupal/includes siteTwo/includes 18.6 ln -s /var/www/drupal/sites/all siteTwo/sites/all 19 Create a symlink from siteTwo /files folder to non-existent /files folder under /drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo (naturally this symlink will appear to be broken, &amp; blinking, but it will work AFTER the drupal install.php script is run… so no worries!) 19.1 ln -s /var/www/drupal/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo/files/ siteTwo/sites/www.wottsamotta.edu.siteTwo/files 20 Copy the needed .php files from siteOne to siteTwo (they are identical) 20.1 cd /var/www/siteOne 20.2 cp *.php /var/www/siteTwo/ 20.3 cd /var/www/siteTwo 20.4 mv DoneThat_install.php install.php 21 Create the symlink that will send real HTTP requests to siteTwo/ and by proxy to drupal/ from the URL: www.wottsamotta.edu/siteTwo 21.1 cd /var/www 21.2 ln -s /var/www/siteTwo /var/www/html/siteTwo 22 Install the second multisite called siteTwo by running the install.php script 22.1 point your browser at: www.wottsamotta.edu/siteTwo/install.php 23 you will be prompted to enter your site info and admin password for siteTwo. 24 Now you should have multiple Drupal sites (siteOne and siteTwo) running from the same database, but with their own uniquely prefixed tables, and running from a single instance of drupal core, and a single sites/default/modules folder where all the contrib modules are stored. just to be safe, move or delete the install.php under siteTwo/ 24.1 cd /var/www/siteTwo 24.2 mv install.php DoneThatAgain_install.php 25 Huzzah!

The signature, clear as day, reads: “Carlos Victor“, but I have never encountered any artist of that name in any reference. Wikipedia credits all the paintings to this mysterious artist. So let me say it first here: the identity of Carlos Victor is almost certainly the wonderful painter Carlos Ochagavia! Take a close look at the following signature samples. The first two are the signed paintings from the Illuminatus! books, Eye in the Pyramid and The Golden Apple. The following signatures are from Ochagavia covers published around the same time (Universe 8 [1978] and Venus Development [1976]). The resemblance is uncanny! Examine the signatures letter by letter &#8212; the beautiful serifs on the C, the heavy dropped serif at the top of the O, the right tilt to the loop on the L and H… this signature is a dead ringer! Now consider the style. The swirling clouds around the central figure are a more finely rendered version of the theme found in Ochagavia’s cover for Glory Game [1980]. The pallette of the undersea mounds is almost identical to that of Venus Development [1976]. The fingers and shadows under the knuckles for the Eye in the Pyramid cover are nearly identical to the tone found in the fingers painted for Retief of the CDT and Glory Game. I’m sure there are more scientific methods to analyze the signatures, pallettes, and styles, but I am going to stake a claim as the first person to positively ID this connection. Yep, you heard it first on Yunchtime! By the way, although I’ve been considering this for years, I was contacted by a relative of Ochagavia this morning and I asked for their assistance in verifying this assertion. But the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that Carlos Victor really was Carlos Ochagavia! I sincerely hope that the popularity of the Illuminatus! books and the strange, intriguing covers featured for their first appearance, will steer more people to the masterful style of Ochagavia.

The crowds that gathered for the gala opening notwithstanding, what really left me stunned were the series of photos showing the painting from sketch to finish, that Williams posted on his sketch blog. The illustrative technique demonstrated in the photo series is quite interesting. The figures are first rendered in with darks then built up in virtual isolation from the background, except for some effortless splotches of background colors splattered on to find the range of values. From there Williams almost seems to be carelessly splattering on the larger shapes of the background tones, but if you take a look at the fine rendering of the shadows, you’ll be left speechless by how exactly the colors are registered. The seemingly ridiculous cartoons sketched in for the sake of balancing the old-fashioned demon caricatures don’t distract from the power of the main figures.

Sure, I expected a tourist rip-off environment, full of honeymooners and frenetic Americans, but except for a moribund afternoon in Lahaina, I managed to avoid the entire tourist scene. I attended no Luau’s, no magic shows, took no helicopter rides over the volcano, nor any snorkel tours, deep-sea fishing boats, whale watches, nightclub acts, or swap meets. Never set foot in a blaring sports bar, saw any hula dancers, took a surfing lesson, chopped coconuts, or ate any taro. Above all, I did not join any stupid caravan of rental cars and tour buses on the nauseating thousand hairpin turns of the “road to Hana,” the top must-do activity for all visits to Maui! Nope, Sophia and I earned our turtle wings as two of the laziest, good-for-nothing beach bums to ever set foot on that gorgeous slab of a’a. We twiddled our toes, listened to the surf, picked starfruit from the trees, and lazed around in the Japanese spa. If only we could extend that feeling forever!

Compared to the startling palettes of his contemporaries in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you’d think that Feck was either taking a lot of downers or painting with deliberate understatement. Yet the more I look at his cover paintings, the more I am convinced that Feck was using a masterful and subtle style. When you look at the cover of Night Probe, for example, you almost have no idea what is going on. Yet the artist has provided just enough detail to hint at the submarine placement of the train, a few bubbles drifting up from the dark hulk of the locomotive towards an indistinct surface. By contrast, the painting for These Gentle Voices almost leaps out, with it’s vivid green hills against a looming blue sky. The woman’s figure rendered with a few economical brush strokes, and the draping of the blue cloak with a tossed off shadow at the elbows and wrists reveals the amazing effects that Feck could effortlessly produce. On the cover for Kull, Feck shatters his cobalt blue monochrome with the blunt-edged red cape…toro! While Demon Seed draws our eyes to the figure through a gossamer tangle of computer cables. Nearly invisible in shadow, the sword in the right hand of the woman warrior on the cover of The Carnelian Throne, means business! She is not whirling it around in some useless melodramatic flourish, with sparkling reflections flashing off the steel blade…no, she is looking pretty confident there in that fascinating copper-ambergris monochrome. The muted colors in the Berlin Escape illustration, are perfectly tuned…the soft hues of the markswoman’s perfect hair and lipstick reveal Feck’s self-control. Who wouldn’t have wanted to boost up that red just a tiny bit? Finally, one has to marvel at the uncharacteristic blaze of colors seen in Feck’s painting for The Twelve Maidens (above), which is in keeping with the subject matter of the book: witchcraft and black magic. The passion and frenzy of the Wiccan ritual is expressed in both the evocative pose of the acolyte and the eerie abstract figures looming out of the darkness. Except for the nice article in Vincent DiFate’s Infinite Worlds, I’ve found hardly any other solid info on Feck. Anyone have any to add?

None other than Irving Sinclar (1895-1969), who was apparently a well-known portrait and commercial artist beginning in the 1930s. According to the SF Chronicle (24 Feb 1969): “Born in British Columbia on March 5, 1895. After settling in San Francisco in 1917, Sinclair worked as a billboard artist for Foster &amp; Kleiser, and in the 1920s was art director for Fox West Coast Theatres. In 1939 he studied in New York under Wayman Adams. San Francisco remained his adopted home where he painted Mayors Rossi, Robinson, and Christopher.

Sinclair died in San Francisco on Feb. 21, 1969.” With such an interesting resumé, I thought that there should be plenty of material online about the artist.

As if dashed off in a hurry, the portrait sings with fervent, nervous energy…I’m gobsmacked by that blue and orange, I tell you! Looking around for more info, I found that a biography has been published by Sinclair’s daughter, Julianne Sinclair Crocket, with her husband Robert Crocket. This looks like a good read. Nonetheless, it seems to be print-on-demand; and at $70 each, I don’t expect to see any second-hand copies floating up on the Brattle Bookshop tables anytime soon. Still, you have to wonder what the authors have in store for us, since Sinclair was evidently a portraitist in high demand. His Churchill (painted in 1952) and a puzzle made during WWII of Gen. MacArthur show both an impish confidence and a respectful air of distance. Clearly, Sinclair was hooked up with the establishment. He painted the official portrait of Senator Harry Pulliam Cain, one-time supporter of Joe McCarthy, and provided the militaristic seascape for the swanky Cliff House in San Francisco. This canvas, curiously, was part of a naming contest, and was eventually called The Power and the Glory. Another interesting discovery was the cover Sinclair painted for the official souvenir program book printed for the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, June 2nd 1937. It’s not his best painting, to be sure, but what strikes me are the clean blue waters frisking into the bay, and the vivid red coat of paint on the spanking new bridge! What a breath of achievement shone from those spans and girders…America was still a land of big shoulders, of impossible dreams, and endless vistas. Speaking of which, the biography by Julianne and Bob Crockett mentioned above, provides a few previews, notably a risqué canvas that was shown at the Treasure Island Expo in 1939. “Gloria was a big hit at the 1939-1940 Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island. Irving’s painting of this beautiful woman was done in glaze. Revolving lights behind the painting produced gently changing reflections across her body.“ Okay, so San Francisco was always a fun town…revolving lights behind their good girl art! Amusing, to be sure, but doesn’t hold a candle to the canvas posted at the beginning…those shocking tangerine highlights! A shoulder rendered in seven agressive pink strokes! That is really something.

This pulp was created by Stanley Horowitz’ Transport Publications following the the success of the weird mystery pulp, Scientific Thriller which appeared in 1948. Thrills Incorporated appeared in March 1950 and lasted for a total of 23 issues, ending in June 1952.

As the editor, Alister Innes, confessed to Molesworth, “In the early issues we were hoodwinked by certain unscrupulous writers who plagiarised American SF stories without our knowledge.

Yates, who quickly became famous for writing a series of mystery stories under the name Carter Brown. The passage quoted above comes from Yates autobiography, a summary of which appears online: “Carter Brown is the pseudonym of Alan Geoffrey Yates who was born in London and educated at schools in Essex. From 1942 to 1946 he served in the Royal Navy as a lieutenant. After the war he worked as a sound recordist at Gaumont-British Films for two years and then moved to Australia in 1948. That same year he became an Australian citizen. Before deciding to write exclusively in 1953, Yates was a salesman in Sydney and a public relations staff member at Quantas Empire Airways. His early books were intended for Australian audiences, but when the Carter Brown series was picked up by the New American Library, he was discovered by Americans. Yates wrote crime, horror stories, and westerns under the pen name of Tex Conrad. For the magazine Thrills Incorporated he co-wrote tales with G.C. Bleek, but his major work in science fiction was Coriolanus The Chariot!, a story about illusions, paranoia, and a toxic game. Soon Yates started to concentrate on crime fiction, producing a flood of books: in 1953 he published Venus Unarmed, The Mermaid Murmurs Murder, The Lady is Chased, The Frame is Beautiful, Fraulein is Female, Wreath for Rebecca, The Black Widow, Weeps, and The Penhouse Passout. In 1958 he published a novel under his own name, The Cold, Dark Hours, and in 1966 he penned the first novels written as Caroline Farr. Under the name Carter Brown, Yates wrote about 150 crime stories between 1953-68, which sold in the tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of copies.” See: Ready When You Are, C.B.! : The Autobiography of Alan Yates Alias Carter Brown Other Thrills Inc writers worthy of mention include Gordon Clive Bleeck, who seemed to be quite a character himself, and the inimitable Norma K. Hemming, for whom an award has been created by the Australian Science Fiction Society, and will be awarded for the first time at the Worldcon 68 (Melbourne) in 2010! Thanks to the late Forry J. Ackerman &amp; datajunkie, you can download Thrills Inc #17 to read the full text of Hemming’s Amazons of the Asteroids. And here is the amazing interior illustration by R. T. Cavanagh: Most of the writing was done under pen-names, such as Paul Valdez, Ace Carter, Roger Garradine, and Bella Luigi, and has been described variously as “just bearable to quite unreadable“ (Blackford, et al). One of the original contributors to Thrills Inc summed up the situation for Australian SF pulps at that time: “At their worst publishers neither knew nor cared what science fiction was all about or what readers expected, and yet somehow expected the suffering public to support their miserable apologies for magazines.” (Graham Stone, as quoted in Blackford, et al, p. 65) Although the writing was considered second rate, some of the cover illustrations were eye-catching, which is the only reason for this blog entry, as you may have surmised. These covers included work by T. Brand (issues 1 - 12), Ray T. Cavanagh (issues 14 - 17), and two excellent covers by Stanley Pitt (issues 21 and 23).

Including a bedroom made up in early 20th Century fashion, occupied by a stuffed animal wolf wearing a sleeping bonnet. This not-very-threatening wolf stares up from the bedstead, wearing it’s ridiculous cotton bonnet, and though the wolf’s fangs are merely printed onto fabric, there is something strangely sinister about the whole apparition. The rest of the property has been turned into a dining room, herb garden, and gift shops where you can buy all manner of old-timey tinctures, trivets, and essential oils. The herb garden was quite nice, it reminded us of the Chulu Ranch, near Taidong, Taiwan, where organic wild vegetables are grown in abundance and served up in heaping platters for an all-you-can eat hot pot buffet. At Pickety Place, the set up is much more low key, just a few rambling gardens of typical Western herbs, no wolfbane, mandrake root, golden valerian, skullcap or yage was to be seen. But we did buy a really lovely lemon verbena…smells wonderful! The lunch was very Western too, lots of creamy things and little imagination. The “five course herbal meal,” consisted of such innovations as hanging a sprig of savory on top of the mundane salad, or sticking hyssop and basil stalks into a sliced tomato so that they loom over your plate like weeds. This is not exactly “cooking” with herbs, though I will admit that herbs appeared on top of every dish, including a bright saffron mini-marigold flower on top of the cheesecake. While we were waiting in the garden for lunch to begin, we found a decent sized frog minding his own business. All in all, this experience was pleasant, if greatly defanged, considering what a bizarre realm of the subconscious Red Riding Hood originates from.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"fairy tales","slug":"fairy-tales","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/fairy-tales/"},{"name":"herbalism","slug":"herbalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/herbalism/"}]},{"title":"Chad Oliver on cities and the alien next door...","slug":"chad-oliver-on-cities-and-the-alien","date":"2009-08-12T02:45:36.000Z","updated":"2017-10-20T19:22:09.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/chad-oliver-on-cities-and-the-alien/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/chad-oliver-on-cities-and-the-alien/","excerpt":"","text":"It was at a Boskone panel two years ago that Howard Waldrop and George Zebrowski turned me on to the works of Chad Oliver. I’m just getting around to reading an old copy of Shadows in the Sun (Ballantine Edition, 1954) which is literally disintegrating page by page as I read it. What an amazing story this is! I can certainly see why Zebrowski picked this title for Crown __Book’s Classics in Modern Science Fiction series. The strangely out-of-tune Jefferson Springs, Texas, at first seems to resonate with menace, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Jack Finney’s novel which was being serialized in Collier’s magazine later the same year, Nov - Dec 1954). But then the story veers into unexpected directions, and though Oliver’s prose is at times poetic, it is always clear and to the point. For example, here is the protagonist, Paul Ellery, reflecting on the human tendency towards urbanization: What sane man would prefer to live in the shrieking chaos of a city, stacked in like sardines with his neighbors in the smoke and the dirt and the sweat? What sane man would voluntarily leave the sunshine and the green fields and the quiet companionship of home for a factory and a tenement and the grinding of machinery? Answer: almost all of them. Wasn’t it the thing to do? Wasn’t the city the place to go to get ahead? Wasn’t the city where all the smart people were? Weren’t you an ignorant hick if you stayed at home? There was nothing new in this. Man had always gone to the city. But he could be helped along if necessary, and he was. Psychological conditioning techniques, when administered by a really advanced culture, were remarkable things. If you want to build an escape-proof prison, there is a way. Just don’t tell the prisoners that they’re in jail. Make them compete with each other for life-sentences. Call it home. Were these merely the musings of a good old boy from Texas, who preferred some fly-fishing to the latest trendy nightclub? Or was Oliver onto to something more sinister? Was he feeling a trend of social manipulation that was actually being implemented in boardrooms and hush-hush committees? Perhaps we will never know, but it does give me pause for thought (as an eternal city-dweller) that he might be onto something. Are there some malevolent forces at work, keeping us away from the farms and wide open spaces, and forcing us to crawl through crowds in foetid subway tunnels, or sit in miles of toxic automobile traffic? Well, it hardly matters, because somehow I think we would gravitate into these human hives on our own accord. There is no subliminal message needed, because we behave, without any prompting, like members of a mathematical formula, and either cluster together like honey-crazed ants, or spread out into mandelbrot sets of suburban tracts. Though the city seems to have imprisoned me for life, it doesn’t stop me from dreaming about those greener pastures somewhere out beyond the edge of a Clifford Simak pastoral, but not so far as that strangely magnetic pond behind R. A. Lafferty’s place, or one of J. G. Ballard’s psychopathological desert verandas. No, in the end it’s probably best to hang around here in my urban cellblock, to content myself with a free showing of Helvetica among the sea of unemployed design nerds at the Regent Theatre, and realize that homo sapiens are far beyond the pale of specialization and have long since moved into the infinite fractals phase. There aren’t any oases left, unless we build them. And we have a lot &#8216;splaining to do if we can’t start by rescuing our own ecosphere, our economy, and our basket case cities. Aliens are not going to arrive and take care of them for us. Unless, of course, they already have!

The protagonist, Dr. Wentik, finds himself forcibly recruited from his scientific research post beneath the South Pole, and whisked away to the Planalto District of Mato Grosso in Brazil. Both of these places are so far off the beaten track and outside of the ordinary world of human affairs that the novel begins with an eerie sense of dislocation, which is only accelerated into total disorientation as soon as Wentik begins to trek into the strangely deforested zone of Planalto. His guide, a tight-lipped man named Musgrove, shows signs of mental illness as the story progresses and Wentik finds himself an occupant of “the jail,” under interrogation by an equally opaque antagonist named Astourde. According to Priest’s website, Indoctrinaire was written under contract to Faber, who published the first edition in 1970, so the actual writing was probably done in 1969. Judging from the cultural moment during which Priest was writing this book, the effects of mind-altering drugs and the edgy awareness of mutually assured destruction were two of major chords he chose for his composition, but the deft handling of the scenario and the ease with which he steers the characters into the realm of the bizarre clearly presaged a major talent. There are echoes of Patrick McGoughan’s _Prisoner_ here, who was able to exercise a certain degree of freedom by moving around a small stage with the other inhabitants, but who was nonetheless unable to escape. That is the gripping wierdness of The Prisoner, after all: the terror in knowing that we are proscribed to certain patterns of behavior by outside forces &#8212; forces unseen and which never are explained. This theme was also touched upon in Hayden Howard’s strange tale, Eskimo Invasion (1967), which starts off in the northern Polar regions of Canada, and whose protagonist remarks: “If I am a prisoner, I can escape. If I am NOT a prisoner, by definition I cannot escape. DAMN! That’s a neurotic thought.” The inscrutible nature of the interrogator, together with the indoctrination techniques being deployed, reminded me of Josef K.’s plight in Kafka’s masterpiece, _The Trial_, and yet they are enhanced by utterly surreal elements that bring the novel into the realm of SF. One such element was a synthetic robot hand, which grows out of a tabletop and stirs into life only to point accusingly at Wentik during his interrogations. Another is an ear that projects disturbingly from the wall of the jail. The interesting thing about Wentik, is that he gradually overcomes his incipient paranoia and begins to investigate the physical characteristics of his surroundings, including the interior of a maze-like structure, whose only purpose seems to be drive people insane. The story-line, which begins with Pavlovian conditioning and progresses through chemically induced behavior modifications, and then to brainwashing, mistaken identity, and deprogramming, also has peripheral plots involving time travel, nuclear holocaust, wireless power sources, and adventures by air, sea and over land. Perhaps I am the only reader to interpet the book this way, but my impression was that the entire novel was a sort of self-induced hallucination, from which Wentik only emerges in the concluding sentence…but I could have it all wrong! I can’t find the quote now, but there is one point at which Wentik wonders to what extent indoctrination occurs not by the actions of outside forces, but simply by the motivation of what we choose to believe. In this sense, we have fabricated our own jails and hospitals out of thin air, and are putting up the greatest struggles against the invisible bonds of our own delusions. There seems to be a good dose of J. G. Ballard’s psychoanalytical drifting, like _Vermillion Sands_, in the wastelands of Planoalto, but they were filtered through an interesting lens and carefully spiced with commentaries on psychotherapy and social science. Ultimately, the utterly rational Dr. Wentik, who successfully navigates a sort of fear-scape of unpredictable dimensions, is shipwrecked on the rocks of his own emotions and beliefs. But that’s the way it appeared to me, in any case… Try it yourself and let me know!

Now I feel compelled to follow up those seven images with yet another appreciation, since I really would like to know more about Savage and his career, which as far as I can tell spanned from the 1930s to 1970s. In this instance, I discovered that what I had assumed to be an amusing bit of fantasy in the cover illustration for John Brunner’s The Long Result, turns out to be the very likeness of the alien who is one of the major characters in the book. Here is the passage describing the remarkable, Anovel, a Regulan visitor to planet Earth: “Anovel stood some five feet eight or nine in height, and his resemblance to a horse was remarkable. He had the same long, rather sad-looking head, and twin nostril-sheaths rose above his eyes to give the effect of a horse’s ears. His skin was a vivid and beautiful blue, while the mane which ran down the nape of his neck was yellow as a buttercup.” What a fine rendition of that odd being Savage provided us! Projecting from the characteristic cloud of faces, in this case a sort of crescent arc that swirls backwards to the left, it is a wonderful picture, indeed. Without spoiling the story for you, there is also an implication of the “crucial facts,” or kenekito, lurking in the oversized eyes of Anovel.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"aliens","slug":"aliens","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/aliens/"}]},{"title":"Readercon 2009:  Apollo 11 and Science Fiction","slug":"readercon-2009-apollo-11-and-science-fiction","date":"2009-07-13T03:41:09.000Z","updated":"2017-10-20T19:31:49.000Z","comments":true,"path":"COSMOS/readercon-2009-apollo-11-and-science-fiction/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/COSMOS/readercon-2009-apollo-11-and-science-fiction/","excerpt":"**Update** Terrific Photo Spread in Boston Globe - Big Picture Did SF become irrelevant after the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969?

This panel explored the relationship between the Apollo program and SF, and the ways in which SF did or didn’t live up to its visionary potentials after manned space flight became a reality. Paul De Fillippo kicked things off by asking to what extent SF inspired the space program? And to what extent did the eventual breakdown of the manned space program affect SF? Karl Frederick (retired NASA physicist and SF author) remarked that one of the most famous examples of SF directly influencing the space program was Fritz Lang’s 1929 classic film “_Woman in the Moon_,” in which the countdown to launch sequence was used for the first time. For his rocketship and launch visuals, Lang relied on the German rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth, and created an SF visualization of the rocket design proposed in Oberth’s 1923 book Rocket into Interplanetary Space [Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen]. Therefore, it was actually a fictional launch sequence that became the paradigm for the real thing. Allen Steele pointed out that once the space program became a reality, the cognitive dissonance between SFnal and actual scenarios began to shift readers’ expectations for SF. “When I read Rocket Ship Galileo in the 4th grade,” said Steele, “I could see right away that the Apollo program had to be different, because we sure as hell weren’t going to be landing on the moon to fight Nazis anymore. After we really did reach the moon, the mismatch between reality and visions of SF became one of timing, or degrees of technological change. For some people, when we didn’t get to see Arthur C. Clarke’s vision of lunar bases by the year 2001, somehow this was an indication that NASA had failed, or that we (SF writers) had failed. I was dealing with these factors for my book Tranquility Alternative, an alternate history of lunar exploration.” “Actually, Apollo was a sort of Manhattan project,” Frederick pointed out. “Apollo was a crash project of national interest. There is no way we could sustain that level of investment.” “We couldn’t sustain it, unless the Russians did,” added Michael J. Daly. Daly went on to say that maybe Star Trek took our imagination too far into galactic space, so that the moon lost its cachet. Frederick: “There’s a deeper question: did society co-opt the future from sf?” By this Frederick meant, presumably, that the national security interests and geopolitics of the space program, by making manifest the rockets, launches and visions of space formerly in the exclusive domain of SF writers’ imaginations, had stolen their thunder. However, the conversation took sudden plunge in a different direction, when Di Fillppo asked for Barry Malzberg’s view. Malzberg said: “I’m sitting here thinking about what I wanted this panel to be, and what it isn’t being. Malcolm Cowley wrote about the issues that were so vital to his generation being swept away… to vanish forever. And I feel the same way right now. To me the issues that seemed so burningly clear to me at the time of the Apollo landing, might be in a different language from what I am hearing. First of all, if we are looking at the manned space program as some kind of progress or achievement then we have it all backwards, because Apollo was clearly doomed! Even by Apollo 8 we could see this. The whole purpose of the Apollo program was to distract the national attention from endless failure happening in Vietnam. As long as the so-called &#8216;national interest’ was about maintaining the illusion of American military supremacy, then it was imperative to keep Apollo going. But you could see that it was doomed and going nowhere if you paid attention. Finally, as the war wound down in humiliation and defeat, Apollo was abandoned. But I knew that Apollo was cooked early on. For example, during Apollo 8 - Borman’s mission of Dec 1968 - when they were reading Bible passages while orbiting the moon, it became obvious to me that this was neither science nor military supremacy, but propaganda. This was a message to citizens, to reprove them, to tell them to love God, to get with the program of patriotism and stop protesting the war.” Steele didn’t agree that NASA was responsible for sending that message. “It was Borman’s idea. There were others in NASA who didn’t want to do that Bible reading business and were afraid of social backlash. I believe Borman did it on his own initiative. Of course, there have been other controversies, such as whether Neil Armstrong came up with his famous quote, and his famous mistake.” That was a reference to Armstrong’s proclamation as the first human to reach the surface of the moon: That’s one small step for (a) man; one giant leap for mankind. Paul Di Fillippo: “Prior to Sputnik, SF was largely about space exploration. After Sputnik we had the reality of a space program, so SF had to be attendent to that reality. But there was little if any commentary inside of SF about the meaning of space program and its technological implications within our societies, and the reflection of how society was being transformed by those new realities. The only works in the 60s that were cognizant of this impact at that time were Malzberg’s and Ballard’s. Generally speaking, we had boosterism, like Niven’s space opera as engineering…SF defaulted on its duty by not being critically aware of the effects of the space program.” Malzberg: “Only Ballard and I were taking on these issues. In Engines of the Night, I pointed out that there was no SF writer who saw the moon landing as a billion-viewer commercially televised event. This point matters to me, because SF cannot be just predictive but visionary.” By this Malzberg was perhaps referring to the classic 2nd chapter of Engines of the Night, L’Etat c’est moi, in which he describes how his 400 word criticism of the NASA Borman mission that was published in the Bulletin of SFWA got him swiftly tossed to the curb. “Where did I get off knocking NASA and the government, the President and Borman, the church and Bible for heaven’s sake, just when the Apollo project, and the enormous attention it garnered were on the verge of making SF an acceptable pursuit?” Malzberg went on : “The first crash in the field of SF was post-sputnik when the magazines collapsed, which you can partially blame on the distributors. But you can’t blame it all on the distributors. What really happened at the same time is that when people who were newly attracted to the field at the dawn of the space race went to the newstands, what did they find? A bunch of insipid magazines full of stuff like a Randall Garrett story about ducks in orbit. These people, a huge new potential readership for SF, fled in droves. The field only recoverd in the mid-sixties due to New Worlds, Ballard, and the influence of the new wave. What infuriated me back in 1969 - and also at this moment! - is that SF doesn’t really take an adequate account of itself and its role as a visionary literature.” Daly: “Barry, when you say visionary, what do you mean by the failure of it? Can SF no longer answer the visionary questions: why shouldn’t we be going to the moon? Why shouldn’t we going to mars?” Malzberg: “Basically, after Sputnik and before New Worlds, SF did not refract the reality of the world we lived in. Ballard was writing about the population in post-Hiroshima world. But if we look at Apollo, it was essentially in a recession, even as it seemed to be in the process of being born. Nobody was getting that.” Karl Frederick: “Thinking back to that time, it seems to me that the space program broke away from SFnal themes, and aligned itself with the examination of moon dust. At the same time, perhaps the effect on SF was to turn it in the direction of engineering and science. By the time of the moon landing SF handed off the ideas to the scientists.” Di Fillippo: “There is the hooked-in, refractive SF which must be au courant and able to serve as a lens for the zeitgeist. Barry is saying that there was a lack of SF of that kind during that time.” Steele: “Barry is correct to point out that one of the misunderstood ideas about SF is that it is supposed to be about the future. But that’s not true. SF is not just predictive, it can be visionary.” Di Fillippo: “Then there are Willie Barton’s recent stories set in the 60s, that shows SF’s guilty conscience about not having adequately pondered these problems back then. Some of the recent John Varley books express the same sub-conscious sense of guilt about SF not examining space exploration well the first time around.” Malzberg: “The fact is that NASA and Nixon were out to make sure that all the romance would be drained from the space program. They were investing to drain the mystery and power from it, and wanted it to project the image of self-assurance, power. If anything went wrong…” Frederick: “Nixon’s paranoia about risk caused the shift from exploration to worry about the image of the program. Nixon was absolutely terrified about safety, not for the astronauts involved, but for the image that an accident would have created around the world.” Malzberg: “Well, even before Nixon, back in the Kennedy administration, after the Bay of Pigs, they immediately announced we’ll go the moon! What was it about? To change the subject immediately… for distraction. But the problem later on for Nixon was not only to distract from Vietname, but that if there was a disaster, the damage to the image of the US would be irrepairable.” Di Fillippo: “At another panel about the manned space program that I was on, all of us came to the realization that Apollo, no matter how it went wrong in the end, was remembered as a shining moment in history. Many in the audience, who weren’t even alive at the time of the landings, still knew of the Apollo program and preserved the idea of mankind exploring outer space as a kind of talismanic achievement.” **POSTSCRIPT** Interestingly, Tom Wolfe seems to share the same perspective as Barry Malzberg… See Wolfe’s long piece for the New York Times.","categories":[{"name":"COSMOS","slug":"COSMOS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/COSMOS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"astronauts","slug":"astronauts","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/astronauts/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"moon","slug":"moon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/moon/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"}]},{"title":"Readercon 2009: Novels You Write vs. Novels You Talk About In Bars","slug":"readecon-2009-novels-we-write-vs-talk-about-in-bars","date":"2009-07-12T15:50:35.000Z","updated":"2017-10-20T19:27:43.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/readecon-2009-novels-we-write-vs-talk-about-in-bars/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/readecon-2009-novels-we-write-vs-talk-about-in-bars/","excerpt":"This panel included Barry Malzberg, Allen Steele, James Morrow, and Rick Wilber.

Rachel Pollack was scheduled to appear, but nobody seemed to know where she was. By way of introduction, Rick Wilber had prepared some sort of pseudo-clever analogy about the panelists, saying that they were at different places along the timeline. Wilber said that Allen Steele, having already published 15 novels was someplace near mid-career, and that James Morrow was “settled” into a successful career with a number of major achievements under his belt. Then Wilber introduced Barry Malzberg, with his long and distinguished career, as “still active in the field…” Somehow you could sense the fumble on that last note, which provoked Malzberg to pounce into action: “What a euphemism!” he roared. “Just say it: I’m an ancient writer, a washed up writer! Remember when Tom Disch said we’re all just &#8216;robots wired for sound?’ Well you can just go ahead and say a corpse wired for sound.” Richard Wilber, recovering, said: “Ok, late career…” “Autumnal!” said Malzberg. This banter was followed by a long description from Allen Steele about the story arcs of his novels. Presumably this was an example of the stories that he does write. If you want to know about that, you can find out everything you need to know over at Allen’s website. James Morrow chimed in to say that his published fiction has been said to be more like late night bull sessions at a ratskeller in college than anything else, so he wasn’t sure where to draw the line between the novels he does write and ones he talks about in bars. Since he doesn’t actually do much hanging around in bars either, he spoke about a novel idea that he planned and outlined, but never committed to paper. The idea came about when he got hired to help develop a curriculum for a college course on the appreciation of Tolkien. Under the circumstances he actually had to pick up the Lord of the Rings trilogy and read it. Morrow found that he was pleasantly surprised by the thematic subtleties and sophistication of Tolkien’s work. At that point, he decided to write his own epic fantasy trilogy. First Morrow read a brief synopsis of the plot, and then he concluded with the question: what if the major thrust of an epic fantasy, instead of questing after some sort of magic charm or talisman, what if the object of the quest was entirely in the realm of epistemology, and a quest for knowledge itself. Not the sort of fantastic “magical” knowledge by one which gains the power to resolve conflicts or terrorize the world, but an exploration into the propositional knowledge and the meaning of knowing. Morrow’s stunning excursion into the airy realm of the conceptual was hilariously brought back to sordid earth by Barry Malzberg, who proclaimed that there was nothing much to say about the books that he did write, because he was just a hack, cranking out words for money. For Malzberg, a book was just 4 to 6 weeks of work, after which an editor forked over several thousand bucks, and that was it. Malzberg summed up his writing career with a quote along the lines of: “He had no challenge, and no ambition. Nothing would defeat him, except talent.” The only thing that Malzberg never wrote but wished he had, was about a world in which mainstream and SF writers cross paths. He wanted to write about a bitter struggle between Eudora Welty and Judith Merrill trying to sell stories to the same editor in New York, against a background which was a hybrid of artiste cliques and slan shacks. Malzberg said that he did do a single story in this vein (“_Another Goddamned Showboat“) about Ernest Hemingway, sitting on the riviera and fulminating because he couldn’t sell a story to John Campbell, while that smart-ass kid, Asimov was getting published month after month. (For more on this topic see Malzberg’s article: Across the Gates_, Apr 2009). Although Malzberg wished he had done more with that idea, he said that there are stories that shoud definitely have stayed in the bar. The one he singled out in particular was Norman Spinrad’s _The Iron Dream_. “It’s a great idea at 2am in the bar,” said Malzberg, “but when you wake up the next day you should shake your head and realize its a bad idea after all.” Picking up the thread, Allen Steele said that he always wanted to do a novel about the history of SF, loosely based on the plot of Citizen Kane. But instead of being a publishing magnate, the protagonist would be the 4th greatest SF writer of world: Nathaniel Arkright. When Steele pitched the idea to editors, they invariably said to him: “this is a great idea, I’d like to read it, but I won’t publish it.” James Morrow proposed that another option to actually writing novels that should have stayed in the beer glass is to write reviews of imaginary novels, as Jose Luis Borges and Stanislaw Lem have done so successfully. As Borges himself wrote: “The composition of vast books is a laborious and impoverishing extravagance. To go on for five hundred pages developing an idea whose perfect oral exposition is possible in a few minutes! A better course of procedure is to pretend that these books already exist, and then to offer a resume, a commentary . . . More reasonable, more inept, more indolent, I have preferred to write notes upon imaginary books.” Prologue to the Garden of Forking Paths, Ficciones. (See also this study of Borges’ imaginary novels.) Morrow pointed to Lem’s “Perfect Vacuum” for an example, where Lem invented a psuedo epic about the tale of Gilgamesh. Lem’s fake epic was a demented variation James Joyce’s technique for Ulysses. On the other hand, said Morrow, there are premises that sound terrible, but sometimes you should just go ahead and do it anyway. “I’ve always believed in the virtues of a bad premise, and that if you can only domesticate it, retrofit it, it will spring to life and achieve unexpected results.“ Morrow cited examples from the personal papers and notes left behind by famous novelists, such as Herman Melville, indicating that their greatest works surprised them by being successful. Malzberg countered: “I got done what I needed to do. But you have to realize that I was entering at such a low profile… I was literally under the radar. I wrote books in five weeks for $3000. Who cared? I don’t even know if I cared. The upside is that I had absolute freedom. If nobody cared what I wrote, I could do absolutely anything. In fact, the 70s wasn’t such a bad period, if you could live with humiliation.“","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"}]},{"title":"The riches of Readercon 2009","slug":"the-riches-of-readercon-2009","date":"2009-07-12T02:58:46.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-riches-of-readercon-2009/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-riches-of-readercon-2009/","excerpt":"","text":"It was great to attend my first Readercon.

John Shirley was scheduled to participate, but got stuck in San Francisco, where I can picture him flailing savagely around in the airport trying to get on any flight to anywhere! The premise of the panel was based on Michael Swanwick&#8216;s contention that “modesty and a reasonable awareness of one’s limitations have no place in a writing career.” Yes, that’s the same Swanwick who declared at Readercon one: “With the possible exception of Gene Wolfe, I’m the best writer here today.” Thus egocentrism… Kelly started off by asking the panelists what was the most egocentric thing they’d ever done as writers. Scott Edelman said that at the ripe age of 13, he sent his first story to Ferman (editor of the Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction). It was a mediocre story based on his first readings of Robert E. Howard’s Conan books, but in the cover letter, he said to Ferman that together, with the publication of his story, they would reinvent the sword and sorcery genre. Quite a gutsy claim! Kelly himself said that early on in his career he wanted to emulate Cordwainer Smith and Alfred Bester by writing a sort of time travel story in which the characters were travelling both forwards and backwards in time simultaneously. He created an analogy for this effect by writing one paragraph in regular left to right prose, then the alternating paragraph backwards from right to left. The story went on to win an award, and then was chosen for an anthology. Unfortunately, when he wrote the introduction to the story he mentioned his intended the homage aspect, and when people realized it, suddenly they weren’t as impressed with it. If he had just kept his mouth shut they might not have noticed, but only by shamelessly comparing his story to those heroes did it begin to pale by comparison. Eileen Gunn said that in her case as a writer she didn’t manifest ego in her fictional work, but in her actions. She quit her job at Microsoft saying “Screw this, I’m getting out of here to write fiction!” She gave up her job and her stock options… and now she’s getting rich as a writer. (Ironic screwed up face followed…) Valente said that there was a challenge to finish a novel in thirty days. What a wimp-out, she thought, to spend a whole thirty days on it! So she wrote her entire 1st novel in ten days. These days, however, she said that she doesn’t have that much piss and vinegar. Gene Wolfe said the most egotistical act of his life, was during a writer’s workshop when he decided to absolutely destroy a student. “This was very egocentric of me. I’m proud of it to this day. At this wkshop someone submitted the worst Arabian Nights knockoff ever written. It was really utterly terrible. So I said to myself that decency goes down the drain and I’m going to tear this person to ribbons, I’m going to destroy him and make him cry. I’m going to shout at him: burn this garbage right now, forget about writing, don’t even pick up a pencil for the rest of your life!” But when the workshop participant came into the room, it turned out to be the biggest, meanest looking white kid he ever saw in his life. Wolfe said: “You know, this is a very interesting story you’ve written.” As it turned out, the author was working as an extra in Hollywood, first as a member of a lynch mob, then as a mobster. He was trying to write based on reading those endless fantasy series novels. Wolfe patiently explained to him that he needed to learn by reading excellent short stories, such as his own. The next topic was on the subject of how such egotism deals with rejections. Wolfe said that at first he didn’t know how to market his work at all. He was sending science fiction stories to Better Homes and Gardens. And naturally he got lots of rejections. In the beginning Wolfe said that he got started writing because his friend was an illustrator for a college literary magazine and asked him to write something to accompany his art. The idea was that they would be a great literary-artistic team. Wolfe tried his hand at a story, but when he submitted the manuscript he was able to actually stand right next to the editor and watch him blue pencil the whole thing. The editor marked up the entire story, tearing it to pieces. In a fury, Wolfe found himself thinking: “this is crap! The next story I write is going to be so good, this guy won’t be able to mark up anything at all.” Of course, the next story was just as bad, and the next one after that. But ultimately, says Wolfe, the trick is to write something so damned good that even if it gets rejected he can just say to hell with that stupid editor, this is damn good! Eileen Gunn said she started at the top, her 1st rejection slip was from New Yorker. “The key,” Gunn said “is to move up to better rejections, that might turn into acceptance.” Gunn had one letter from Gardner Dozois who wrote: “Eileen, they may hang me for this, or fire me, but what the hell, I’m feeling dangerous! So I’m going to publish it…” You never know what the turning point from rejection to acceptance will be! Kelly said that he was a pretty bad typist, and it took him a week to type up a manuscript. Then it would take six more weeks to send out and get rejected. He’d do this over and over. The problem was, after a year, the manuscript had been sent around so many times it gets kind of beat up and wrinkly looking. “So I’d pull out the ironing board and flatten them out,” said Kelly. “Now if you dig up some of those old manuscripts from my files they look like the fucking magna carta, all brown around the edges.” Kelly’s advice is basically to just keep sending them out. Only after sending them EVERYWHERE do you consider rewrite. This is an expression of the egocentricity. You have to say NO to the people who say NO to you. If you can’t do this, then the bastards will grind you down. Edelman said that he probably has the record for rejections at the table, over a 1,000. “When you get a bad review laugh about it,” he advised. “Believe in the story. Not in the editor, whose tastes might be different. For example, I would always send a story to George Scithers first, because I knew he would hate it. I could picture him there, fuming at my story, growing apoplectic with fury. And the rejection letters I got from him would practically burst into flame. Everyone else seemed pretty friendly compared to Scithers.” Talking about Scithers, Wolfe said that once, at the Nebula awards session, George Scithers was talking about how great he was as a writer and what a gem of a story he wrote that was up for the award. But, standing behind him on the stage, Terry Carr was shaking his head, frowning sourly, and making thumbs down sign. Said Wolfe, “I was determined to stamp him into the ground for that, to get my revenge. But then he went and died first, so I never got to grind his face in the dirt.” Someone in the audience asked, have any of you written a story just to take down another story? Kelly said that he wrote “Think Like a Dinosaur“ in response to “The Cold Equations,” because that story was getting all sorts of attention as a “hard SF” piece which he didn’t think it merited at all. At the end of the session, Barry Malzberg, who had been standing in the background throughout, said: “I just wanted to make a statement: I wrote you years ago to say that your story Think Like a Dinosaur was not written in response to The Cold Equations, but to Rogue Moon by Budrys.” So it turned out that Barry had the last word at the ego panel.","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"readercon","slug":"readercon","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/readercon/"}]},{"title":"Only a sample...","slug":"only-a-sample","date":"2009-07-01T02:25:32.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:13:47.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/only-a-sample/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/only-a-sample/","excerpt":"","text":"This “sample page” appears on Golden Age Comics blog, and makes me wonder if the wolfbane is blooming yet!

I know, dear reader, you will be startled to hear such a thing, since all you encounter on my blog are absurdities, and many seemingly juvenile links to old comic books and science fiction artists. But there is reason encoded behind the screen of disconnected trivia that you find here. In fact, I am arranging these posts into a secret code; nor would it especially please me to know that you have figured it out…the news is not pretty! These are clues, do with them what you will. But mind you, time and decades are flashing past like lightning! Like a cinder snapping out of a burning log in the fireplace, ride this moment like a rocket… What of these four-plus decades? A few sparks in the fire? If life is actually lived, awareness begins to unravel the basic mystery of how the human race got this way. Then we begin to wonder, in the words of Mario Vargas Llosa, at what precise moment had humanity fucked itself up? This mystery has everything to do with progress, liberty, and enlightenment. Unfortunately, it also has to do with the forces pitted against those ideals: devolution, slavery, and the dark ages. It is a momentous struggle, a struggle without end, each moment of it is collapsing into parallels of the past and future like a telescoping spyglass at certain junctures in the tube. As I was listening to the friendly bunch of Drupal developers at the Design Camp yesterday, it occurs to me that there are almost identical moments in the midst of paradigm shifts and revolutions…moments when groups of thinkers, of artists, or workers who have been cast to the dogs by the ancien regime suddenly begin to operate according to new principles for survival. In those moments, although it is not at all obvious, a heightened level of inventiveness is combined with a complete abandonment of social conventions. It is the molting of old skin and the revival of the human spirit. Only afterwards is the moment precisely known, and in retrospect certain figures are found to be at the center of the storm, leaping and shouting for new direction. It’s been called creative destruction, though I think that is unfairly negative a term. It is the old status quo that destroys itself, utterly and completely, by greed, corruption, and the madness of power. The pioneers were merely sailing out of the destruction on a raft made of their own vision, and they were actively creating the future. It was their rejection as totally illegitimate the power structures of the past, that allowed them to escape, not their engagement with the past in order to destroy it. All of this sinks into my mind in a flash, because it was only forty years before I was born that Rodchenko was in the very throes of the futurist - constructivist rebellion, designing the posters, shoes, and tea kettles for Russia reborn. Lenin and the vanguard had not yet gone mad, Stalin was merely a shadow looming up from south, and a young artist could throw himself like a sky-diver from the old schools of art into the embrace of world-changing technologies. Listen: “A constructive life is the ART of the future. ART which has not entered life will be numbered and handed over to the archaeological museum of Antiquity… The Future doesn’t build monasteries for the Roman Priests, Prophets, and Holy Fools of art. DOWN with Art as a bright patch on the mediocre life of a propertied class. DOWN with art as a precious stone amid the dirty, dark life of the poor man. DOWN with art as a means to ESCAPE A LIFE that isn’t worth living! LIFE, a conscious and organized life, capable of seeing and constructing, is contemporary art. A person who organizes his life, work, and himself is a contemporary artist. Work for LIFE, and not for Palaces, Temples, Cemeteries, and Museums. Work in the midst of everyone, for everyone, and with everyone. DOWN with monasteries, ateliers, studios, offices, and islands.“ Rodchenko [22 Feb 1921] This was only forty short years before I was born! And in those years Russia went from horse drawn buggies to sending Gagarin on a rocket around the Earth. And during the short years of my own life, we have gone from the space age to the very edge of singularity. I am telling you straight out: TODAY, at this very moment, we are in the midst of the very same technological revolution as the Russian Futurists…but most people are still unaware of what is happening! Newspapers are meaningless anachronisms, automobiles are gas sucking dinosaurs, banks have been stripped naked and shown to be skeletons built on fantasies, while our governments are run by gangs of pirates, pederasts, vampires and devils howling at the moon. Doesn’t anyone get it? We are in exactly the same revolution as Rodchenko, and anyone who comprehends the paradigm shift must be obligated to bring everyone else to the other shore.

There are some playful jabs at democracy, individualism, and even the tyranny of the uninformed voters (a la John Stuart Mill). The tone is not as playful as Ron Goulart, but definitely not very serious either. So it came as a pleasant surprise when the protagonist, Ronny Bronston, is given a sarcastic lecture by his handler, the mysterious Tog Lee Chang Chu, on the disasters brought about by “industrial feudalism.” How strangely familiar! “Oh, I don’t know,” Tog mused. “I don’t have much regard for Industrial Feudalism, myself. It starts off with a bang, but tends to go sterile.” “Industrial feudalism,” he said indignantly. “What do you mean? The government is a constitutional monarchy with the king merely a powerless symbol. The standard of living is high. Elections are honest and democratic. They’ve got a three-party system…” “Which is largely phony,” Tog interrupted. “You’ve got to do some reading between the lines, especially when the books you’re reading are turned out by the industrial feudalistic publishing companies in Avalon.” “What’s this industrial feudalism you keep talking about? Avalon has a system of free enterprise.” “A gobbledygook term,” Tog said. “Industrial feudalism is a socio-economic system that develops when industrial wealth is concentrated into the hands of a comparatively few families. It finally gets to the point of a closed circle all but impossible to break into. These industrial feudalistic families become so powerful that only in rare instances can anyone lift himself into their society. They dominate every field, including the so-called labor unions, which amount to one of the biggest businesses of all. With their unlimited resources they even own every means of dispensing information.” “You mean,” Ronny argued, “that on Avalon you can’t start up a newspaper of your own and say whatever you wish?” “Certainly you can, theoretically. If you have the resources. Unfortunately, such enterprises become increasingly expensive to start. Or you could start a radio, TV or Tri-D station—if you had the resources. However, even if you overcame all your handicaps and your newspaper or broadcasting station became a success, the industrial feudalistic families in control of Avalon’s publishing and broadcasting fields have the endless resources to buy you out, or squeeze you out, by one nasty means or another.” Ronny snorted. “Well, the people must be satisfied or they’d vote some fundamental changes.” Tog nodded. “They’re satisfied, and no wonder. Since childhood every means of forming their opinions has been in the hands of industrial feudalistic families—including the schools.” “You mean the schools are private?” “No, they don’t have to be. The government is completely dominated by the fifty or so families which for all practical purposes own Avalon. That includes the schools. Some of the higher institutions of learning are private, but they, too, are largely dependent upon grants from the families.” Ronny was irritated by her know it all air. He tapped the book he’d been reading with a finger. “They don’t control the government. Avalon’s got a three-party system. Any time the people don’t like the government, they can vote in an alternative.” “That’s an optical illusion. There are three parties, but each is dominated by the fifty families, and election laws are such that for all practical purposes it’s impossible to start another party. Theoretically it’s possible; actually it isn’t. The voters can vary back and forth between the three political parties but it doesn’t make any difference which one they elect. They all stand for the same thing—a continuation of the status quo.” “Then you claim it isn’t democracy at all?” Tog sighed. “That’s a much abused word. Actually, pure democracy is seldom seen…” &lt;p&gt; Yes, Reynolds wrote this in 1961. Not much has changed, has it? Depressing, but true. Now where is Tom Paine when you need him? Because we are in desperate need of real change... Not the warmed over bullshit that Obama is feeding us. Rendition...&lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt;. Preventive Detention...&lt;em&gt;stays&lt;/em&gt;.

What must a barnstorming demonstration have been like at Kazan in the year 1912? At a time when the world was being transformed by new technology, here was a living vision of speed, of man’s ascent to the skies, of futurism come knocking at the skulls of old consciousness, and the dawning of a new age of man. According to Rodchenko, on Sunday, June 3rd, 1912: Again, Kazan is all aflutter. There’s dust in the air from the automobiles, carriage drivers, horsecars… Crowds, the streets are full… As though people were out to greet icons… The flight of A. A. Vasiliev… He’s dressed in a white suit and English boots. A white hat, pale face… A genuine Englishman, with an aquiline nose, a jutting chin, a pipe in his teeth… The propellor creaked, and it soared into space, strong, smooth… I thought: &#8216;Now you’ve forgotten about the earth, forgotten about our filthy, vulgar earth! You are a hero - alone - you forced us to be amazed at your daring.’ And I saw how the cowardly hearts of the viewers beat wildly, and they whispered: &#8216;Terrifying,’ and everyone thought: &#8216;What if he falls!’ Everyone wanted you to succeed, but they wanted to see you fall even more. They wanted a spectacle… Two times you flew overheard between the sun, and for a moment it couldn’t be seen in the rays… He landed evenly, smoothly… His hair was in disarray, his face was sweaty, but he was pleased… &lt;p&gt; &lt;!--more--&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How true! As anyone facing the abyss of radical transformation knows, the cowards will hang back and applaud for the hero who tries to save them all by leaping into the unknown, but at they same time they secretly hope to see blood and to have their trepidation vindicated. So what if the adventurer is sweating from the grueling effort of biting the wind behind a spluttering engine, as the wire frame of his machine is creaking and screaming to snap into a million pieces...the scene of his audience with their necks craned below him is a single frozen snapshot taken from a rapid glance out of the cockpit...so what if his brow is beaded with sweat, then? Surely it is a feverish happiness to blaze forward into the unknown! Who would trade that for the clammy sweat of terror ringing the necks of those spectators, as they gasp for breath like fish trying to look up above the surface of their water tanks? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://www.yunchtime.net/misc/Vasiliev_A_A.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Who was Vasiliev? Now almost unknown, he was the winner of the grueling pioneer aviation race from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1911. Out of eleven pilots who started, he was the only one to make it all the way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khodynka_Field&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Khodynka Field&lt;/a&gt;. Vasiliev went on to set other records, such as flying more than 700 miles in 24 hours. During his barnstorming tour of Russia in 1912, he touched down at Kazan, for the demonstration flight witnessed by Rodchenko, but of course he was only one of several daredevil Russian aviators setting the skies ablaze. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the other pioneers was Igor Sikorsky, who developed and built his own planes after rigorous testing in a wind tunnel. Today, we know the name Sikorsky primarily from the various aircraft produced by the company he founded, such as the Sikorsky helicopter. But did you ever imagine the real Sikorsky? Duded up in his leather flying outfit and challenging the heavens, wasn&apos;t he like a mad version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Waldo_Pepper&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Waldo Pepper&lt;/a&gt;, revved up on vodka, some tantalizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://u.nu/538a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nastasya Filippovna,&lt;/a&gt; and fantastic passion for the moment? Well here he is... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;http://www.yunchtime.net/misc/Sikorsky.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;238&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; and even moreso, thanks to these oddballs who remind us that the big jumbo airliners we take for granted were once as awe-inspiring as lightning bolts that struck the very gods from the heavens above and brought mankind screaming into the modern age.

The image, as a whole, is strangely ethereal; is it a realistic painting, softened at the edges? Or a surrealistic painting, with a few concrete objects for our gaze to anchor upon? Ochagavia tantalizes us to find out…but often as not, the books being illustrated hold few clues as to what the artist was thinking. Carlos Ochagavia was born in 1913, in the city Logrono, Spain, capital of the Rioja wine district, but moved with his parents at the age of two to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ochagavia studied painting at both the Academia National de Bellas Artes and La Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes. In 1937, Ochagavia studied in New York on a scholarship from the Art Student’s League. He worked primarily as a fine artist and animator in Argentina, but has also worked as an illustrator for projects as diverse as science fiction paperbacks and commemorative stamps for the United Nations. What got me interested in Carlos Ochagavia was the mind-blowing cover he painted for Keith Laumer’s Plague of Demons which came out in a Pocket Books edition in 1979. Stamping across a bright (almost gaudy) palette, a row of fanciful, chunky robots are on the march. The outline of a cosmic tentacled being floats high up in the vivid orange sky. The marching robots have hilarious bubble-gum pink brains floating sideways in transparent domes, which softens the image of a stylish humanoid who seems hungry to chomp into a recently removed robot brain. Crouched in hiding, the brain-stealing monster with his rock-star hair and oversized claws, also seems more impish than terrifying…and yet, this cover had me hypnotized in a spell of weirdness! At that time, 1979, I quickly scouted around and found a few more covers painted by Ochagavia for Pocket Books. One of them was for Retief of the CDT, with the protagonist as a semi-transparent figure looming over an alien landscape. Once again the palette is startlingly bright, yet masterfully controlled into a spectrum of blue to yellow. The shapes of the landscape come into focus as they near the foreground, where unnaturally thick leaves are twisting like fat ribbons around pink globes, and hidden figure is brandishing a silly looking ray gun &#8212; sort of a mini-bike muffler stuck into a cigar box. One of Ochagavia’s typical silly space ships is center stage, like a brass-plated duck head wearing ski-goggles. A related image is found on the cover of Retief and the Warlords, where the duck-ship has been flattened and lost a pair of side-panels. Here the background is not cooly fading into transparency, but is dramatically brought into relief by backlighting - not once, but in two separate zones of color. How strange. Almost as a throwaway, Ochagavia sketches in some very faint mounds of translucent bubbles in the middle distance, and in front of those the protagonist appears as a tiny toy soldier, brandishing a rifle from a stone archway. The delightful foreground figures in this painting are absurd aliens with white tusks and delicate frog’s hands…a set of lobster claws are tacked onto their shoulders as an absurdist afterthought! Here the fat tendrils of the plants are as unrealistic as the legs of dancers in Fernand Leger paintings. On the cover for Emissary to the Stars the same duck head space ship appears in the background, having shed its goofy side-panel wings, and swapped chunky landing struts for a soft rocket flare, it almost begins to look like a regular SF spaceship…but it’s absurdly oversized “windshield” and “topknot” remind us that this is still a realm of whimsy. The interesting aspect of this cover is that it is a cut-away view of an alien landscape, showing us the subsurface world of fanciful bugs as they are hatching out of burning spherical eggs and crawling up to the surface. The bugs are about as menacing as trilobytes or macaroni, and the protagonist is yet another toy soldier…this time riding a parachute down over a distant half-visible moon. A fine surrealistic fantasy…and an amazing insight into the mind of Ochagavia, since it is such a strange abstraction of the novel’s story. Part of the charm of these illustrations is their disinterest in the technology of “hard” science fiction; while acknowledging the general idea of futuristic vehicles and weapons, the forms are softened and embedded in the playful surrealism of the imagery as a whole. This trick is pushed even farther in the cover for Retief’s War, where a shimmering alien city looms in the background, while the hero is disguised in a bizarre half-lobster, half-monster costume and brandishes only a wooden club. The only technology here is an old wooden wheel, engulfed in the spectacular alien life forms: lush vegetation and harmless creatures. This painting is both a farce and a masterpiece, it’s smoothly rendered artificiality is like something Henri Rousseau might have dreamed. The surrealist mission is most blatant in the cover for The Third Body, where starkly rendered hollow figures loom up like figures from DeChirico, and crisp shadows delineate the shapes as they drape over a Dali dustscape, littered with old swords and disconnected forms. But the desire to carefully construct the yellow piping on the hollow-headed figure’s uniform, along with the red buttons on its neck, is very much Ochagavia’s style, as is the tracery of constellations written in the sky. The strangeness of the image is accentuated by the blue sky, green grass, and liveliness of the scene that is visible through the aperture of the hollow face, while every other angle reveals only ruins and dust. Is this time travel, delusion, an alternate dimension? Short of finding this book and reading it, I can only guess! One of my favorite covers by Carlos Ochagavia is for The Glory Game, where the characters are portrayed as figures on a deck of playing cards floating over an alien landscape. The conceit of the idea is rendered with a masterful, almost effortless style, and is embued with a dreamy surreal power. The main figure on the largest card is portrayed as a mirror image…his hands, though gripping a futuristic rifle in one direction, also magically appear to be draped correctly when turned upside down! Sprouting from the protagonist’s spacesuit helmet is an air hose that resembles either a slender dog’s leg or a tiny elephant’s trunk, and yet his bare arms are fine, underneath the folds of a magenta vest. If we pull back our gaze to see the top and the bottom figure together, the vest forms a beautiful X through the center of the playing card. Accentuating the dream-like quality of the scene is a cloud that somehow passes through the card, so that the card, tilted back in perfect perspective, is at once in the foreground, and at the same time floating through the clouds. Alien icons have replaced the traditional suits (of clubs, hearts, spades and diamonds) in the deck, and except for a cameo appearance of Darth Vader, we are left to wonder what the other cards look like, as they fan out like feathers floating down from the distant sky. Interwoven behind the tumbling deck of playing cards are traceries of astrogation paths in the dark green sky. The only vehicle seen is a weird skimmer craft, with oversized chunky legs larger than the cabin. The alien landscape is rendered in tiny, semi-transparent shapes, fading away into the green distance, with the only sign of life being a single gnarled tree-trunk. This cover, as unusual as it is for a “hard” science fiction paperback cover, remains one of my favorites for its quiet, yet powerful dreaminess. Finally I would like to share a full view of the excellent cover painting for Venus Development (1976), that I stitched together from a very fine copy of the original paperback (found after several years of searching). In this lush painting, the body of Venus is the landscape, her hair a waterfall, and the strange Ochagavian plants, with their golden flower globes seem to writhe over a pool of alien lotus pads. The spaceship is modestly painted in the same tone as the sky, as the dreaming figure of Venus faces the disc of planet Earth. There is hardly a word that can express the beauty of this breath-taking painting, except to say that it is crazy to think that such a masterpiece can appear once on a paperback and never be seen again! Let’s help to correct that by celebrating the works of Ochagavia here, and passing these images along to those who didn’t know about them.

What more can be said about a stylist who brandishes a fist in our face with an opening paragraph like this? What true-bred city sportsman has not in his day put off the most urgent business &#8212; perhaps his marriage, or even the interment of his rib &#8212; that he might “brave the morn” with that renowned pack, the Surrey subscription foxhounds? Lives there, we would ask, a thoroughbred, prime, bang-up, slap-dash, break-neck, out-and-out artist, within three miles of the Monument, who has not occasionally “gone a good &#8216;un” with this celebrated pack? And shall we, the bard of Eastcheap, born all deeds of daring to record, shall we, who so oft have witnessed &#8212; nay, shared &#8212; the hardy exploits of our fellow-cits, shall we sit still, and never cease the eternal twirl of our dexter around our sinister thumb, while other scribes hand down to future ages the paltry feats of beardless Meltonians, and try to shame old Father Thames himself with muddy Whissendine’s foul stream? Or a “society dance” scene like this? The ball proceeded with the utmost decorum, for though composed of shopkeepers and such like, there was nothing in their dress or manner to indicate anything but the best possible breeding. Jorrocks, indeed, fancied himself in the very élite of French society, and, but for a little incident, would have remained of that opinion. In an unlucky moment he took it into his head he could waltz, and surprised the Countess Benvolio by claiming her hand for the next dance. “It seems werry easy,” said he to himself as he eyed the couples gliding round the room; &#8212; “at all ewents there’s nothing like trying, &#8216;for he who never makes an effort never risks a failure.’” The couples were soon formed and ranged for a fresh dance. Jorrocks took a conspicuous position in the centre of the room, buttoned his coat, and, as the music struck up, put his arm round the waist of his partner. The Countess, it seems, had some misgivings as to his prowess in the dancing line, and used all her strength to get him well off, but the majority of the dancers started before him. At length, however, he began to move, and went rolling away in something between a gallop and a waltz, effecting two turns, like a great cart-wheel, which brought him bang across the room, right into the track of another couple, who were swinging down at full speed, making a cannon with his head against both theirs, and ending by all four coming down upon the hard boards with a tremendous crash &#8212; the Countess Benvolio undermost, then the partner of the other Countess, then Jorrocks, and then the other Countess herself. Great was the commotion, and the music stopped; Jorrocks lost his wig, and split his Beelzebub breeches across the knees, while the other gentleman cracked his behind &#8212; and the Countess Benvolio and the other Countess were considerably damaged; particularly the other Countess, who lost four false teeth and broke an earring. Not to mention the riding and hunting scenes: _A stopper appears &#8212; a gate locked and spiked, with a downward hinge to prevent its being lifted. To the right is a rail, and a ha-ha beyond it &#8212; to the left a quick fence. Tom glances at both, but turns short, and backing his horse, rides at the rail. The Yorkshireman follows, but Jorrocks, who espies a weak place in the fence a few yards from the gate, turns short, and jumping off, prepares to lead over. It is an old gap, and the farmer has placed a sheep hurdle on the far side.

The idea is along the lines of Christaller’s central place theory, in which the demand for goods and services drives the spatial distribution of human settlements. In the article, Strogatz draws a parallel between Zipf’s law as it has been used to show the relative size in cities, and the ways in which biological organisms develop into holistic systems. There is a self-determining economy of scale that occurs, whether in the exfoliation of leaves on a tree, the distribution of tissues in a human body, or the amalgamated infrastructure of a modern metropolis. It turns out that the efficiencies gained by hiving together are a natural driver which brings all us living beings &#8212; kicking and screaming in defiance, to be sure! &#8212; together into super-organisms.

Many of us caught in this infrastructure find it extremely difficult to get around in anything but the car. The distances are just too great for bicycles, the densities just too low to allow efficient, affordable transit. In many ways, I couldn’t agree more with Register’s suggestions, many of which were echoed by Antonio Di Mambro in his recent speech at Boston Public Library. Of course we need to rethink the functionality of the city, to reduce the incessant automobile trips, to improve access for bicycles and pedestrians, and to restore our creeks and aquifers. But as Di Mambro pointed out when he approached the City of Dallas with a Memorandum of Understanding about the development of the South Dallas area, the city council “didn’t speak that kind of language in Texas.” It is good to know that a gradual awakening is taking place. More programs for sustainable development, and sustainable planning are producing graduates who no longer believe that creating endless sprawl is their “job.” Old timers and young’uns alike can relate to the warnings of ecological failure in Chip Ward’s excellent piece, Too Big to Fail. Even so, I find some aspects of Register’s proposals starkly unrealistic. We should make maps of our cities to identify densification areas and look for creeks to restore? Haven’t we been doing this continuously for decades? There aren’t any more creeks to be found in Boston or Toledo. It is not a question of coming up with a good plan! The problem is total automobile dependence. Pure and simple. Let us define THAT as the problem and attack the sickness at its source. Now that automobile corporations are reeling and staggering from their own inefficiencies, the bicycle - pedestrian - mass transit - urban ecology - alternate energy sectors should deliver a supersonic lightning kick to their balls! All together, now! To hell with those crapulent dinosaurs! Close the blighted factories down right now and retool them to produce modular, super efficient housing components and electric mass transit vehicles. It is not too much to ask for 10% of all city streets be immediately converted into greenways where NO motorized vehicles are allowed. Indeed, that is a very modest proposal. What we should be demanding is the end of this stupid era; an era dominated by energy companies and corporate thieves, who have gone totally beserk with greed. Of course, we need all of our Registers and Di Mambros, advocating the intelligent alternative…but we also need to get people out of their stinking hell-buckets on wheels, and get them back into touch with Mother Earth. Until we get people onto bicycle / pedestrian trails that connect with mass transit, all of these eminent plans are wishful thinking. Isn’t it shameful that we must look back fifty years to Mumford and Jacobs for good ideas, or back to the garden city of the 30s! Instead of dealing with the core problem - the gas burning demon - we sit wistfully thinking about how things might have been. The fact is that we are living in Ballard’s High Rise, and breaking down on his Concrete Island, and we are stuck up Kunstler’s cul-de-sac… the city has been designed by Mister X, and has unfurled itself into a psychetecture that we apparently can neither break nor escape. The only way out of this is to trade in the car (a $4,000 per year albatross around our necks) for shiny new hybrid bikes ($400, and they last forever with minor repairs you can do yourself!).

Something about the half-cooked, gooey, pancake-like sphere, slightly browned on the outside, with little rubbery bits of chewy octopus tentacles inside, that simply drives Japanese people crazy with delight! These snacks are not always served in splendidly decked out shops like the Red Devil Takoyaki House of Namba, Osaka. Typically they are vended from funky little carts found alongside bus stations, baseball stadiums, or tourist spots. A little paper dish of those fresh grilled octopus balls, dribbled with sticky brown sauce (with a soya tang), is almost irresistible in the land of the Rising Sun… How great to know that you can now enjoy this sensation anywhere &#8212; well almost anywhere &#8212; thanks to the Frito Lay corporation, who have packaged up a neat ersatz version. The Frito Lay takoyaki tei (“grilled octopus stand”) boasts of a super thick, delicious “sauce,” depicted as flowing in an airborne swirl over the head of a prototypical uber-cute pink octopus cartoon. For some reason that floating swirl of sauce &#8212; frozen in mid-air &#8212; recalls the image of the girl being launched into freeze time as she crashes her scooter in Kamikaze Girls. The fact that the actual product is some kind of genetic half-breed of a Funyon and a Shrimp Chip, laced with sparkling flecks of MSG and aonori powder, and is completely dry seems not to bother the marketing folks one bit. Indeed, they know perfectly well that anyone crunching a mouthful of these cheese-puff style octopus balls will succumb to an instant case of cottonmouth so intense that they will scramble wildly for the nearest bottle of beer or sparkling water. Even so, it was a super special treat to try a pack of these, graciously given to us by our friend Kumi, who had them airlifted in all the way from Tokyo!

In addition to the classic newstand headline: Agnew Breaks Wind, Thousands Die! this comic featured a paranoid schizophrenic Richard Nixon being replaced as President by an even more freaked out long-haired capitalist, Amphetamine Arnie. In his new essay, Skip provides some great background material on the E.C. Comics vs. Fred Wertham period of suppression, and the Kurtzman - Help era that subsequently inspired rebellious cartoonists everywhere. Skip begins and ends his excellent piece with thoughts on freedom and liberty: When the Underground Comix movement initially detonated it was asking the didactically loaded question, “Do you really mean Freedom of the Press?” This was a group of artists, working without economic expectation, expressing art without society’s polite restraints, while employing an intrinsically American cultural curiosity, the Comic Book, as its delivery system. Indeed, the necessity of the Underground is felt even more keenly after living through the wannabe fascist hell of the Bush-Cheney junta. We need not remind ourselves that freedom is an act of affirmation about being alive, and not an act of begging after the table-scraps left to us by our masters. John Stuart Mill **understood this perfectly: The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest. Therefore we should be forever on our guard against those who, proclaiming freedom, are swinging tasers and handcuffs or who walking around with stacks of Bibles and tweaker-crazed eyes. Let us remember not only the WORDS of the great Rev. Martin Luther King, but also the MEANING of them when he said LET FREEDOM RING! As for the revisionists of the extreme right, claiming they are not neo-cons, claiming to believe in the Constitution (even as they shred it and enable torture!)… aren’t they pushing the limits of reverse irony a little too far? Or are they actually ignorant of what ridiculous jackasses they make of themselves, with their teabagging parties? Well, it doesn’t matter, thank the stars! Because the obsolescence of the greed-heads is now accelerating faster than Moore’s Law… and good riddance to those uptight traitors!

If any of this interests you, perhaps you will be as delighted as I was to discover the CBS Radio Play version of the Space Merchants, which was broadcast in February 1957. The producers managed to compress the novel into one hour and still retain the gist of the storyline. Additionally, the play has the charming feel of the period, the sound effects, and whiskey-filtered speedy accent of the Madison Avenue advertiser. Anyone amused (or bemused) by the antics of the t.v. series Mad Men, might enjoy hearing a period piece that captures some of the sound and tone of the real thing. Not to mention some classic SF humor. “I’ve been Shanghaied, robbed of my name, forced to work as a slave in the tropics…” fumes the protagonist, but with a snide, condescending air. You can almost choke on the greed and superiority complexes of the major characters, very similar to the venal jackals of our own times, who continue to pay themselves millions even as they flee for the exits! While the empty Mammon of financial instruments that they invented comes bursting down upon us all in a shower of rivets and duct tape, they merely dust themselves off, disdainfully flicking a few lawsuits our way, since they have been denied their rightful stream of income… How we wish that all of these swine could be thrown into the growing vats of Chicken Little, having stripped them of their ill-gotten wealth and supplied them with shovels. Well, who knows? It may be the right time for this meme to finally make it onto to big screen! In the meantime, let’s enjoy this great adaption from the 1950s: Space Merchants (two parts) CBS Radio Workshop, February 1957 Note: While working on this draft, Fred Pohl posted an anecdote about how Space Merchants nearly became a Broadway play.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"audio","slug":"audio","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/audio/"},{"name":"society","slug":"society","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/society/"},{"name":"piracy","slug":"piracy","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/piracy/"},{"name":"advertising","slug":"advertising","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/advertising/"}]},{"title":"Society doesn’t need newspapers.

During these last five hundred years, the cost of print production and the profits made on the distribution of printed objects was tightly bound up with dissemination of knowledge, art, technology, and of information of all kinds. Now, with the advent of the Internet and the speedy exchange of digital objects of all kinds, the flawless reproduction of information-laden media objects is no longer bound to the burdens of physical products that must be moved through space. The near-frictionless pathways that our digital infrastructure provides, has creatively destroyed the entire centuries-old paradigm of manufacturing, selling, and regulating the rights for commerce for media such as books, recordings, images, at least in the material manifestions that we have come to know and love. Now the consumer and the producer are marching ahead, devouring digital objects and frollicking in the waterhose torrent of information that has been unleashed. The terror of the current revolution, naturally, is felt by the capitalist monopolies and syndicates that have built their fortunes on the manufacture and distribution of the old-world “meat media.” The behavior of the RIAA, randomly suing patsies among the 99% of the population that loves to download digital media, is much like the little Dutch Boy with his finger in the dike. From the perspective that Shirky provides they much more pathetic, since at least the Dutch Boy was trying to prevent his whole community from being flooded, while the RIAA are only trying to keep all their ill-gotten wealth from spilling out to the masses. In any case, back to the interesting question: how can we shape a new and effective model for the practice of journalism and the dissemination of news? The argument about whether bloggers are journalists or whether newspapers are bastions of professionalism is, I think, moot. There are good and bad examples on both sides of the fence. We cannot blame journalists for seeking to work in the only available venue that sustains them…even as we wrinkle our noses at the high percentage of propaganda, disinformation, ridiculous tripe, and outright lies surrounding every decent piece of reporting that actually makes it into print. Similarly, we cannot castigate all bloggers just because some of them are whining fools, or mistake scurrilous gossip for muckraking. In my view, what we need is a social transformation regarding the production and consumption of news. For example, the idea that Associated Press or Reuters are doing a good job is laughable. They are so completely owned and corrupted by their corporate masters that half of what they send out on the wire directly contradicts the other half. One day you will discover that eating Asparagus will give you gastric ulcers and brain tumors, then the next day you will be told that Asparagus alone will cleanse your body so effectively of toxins that eating it will extend your life by a decade. These, of course, being paid for by the Asparagus Cancer vaccine corporation, and the Asparagus Farmers testing laboratory, respectively. It is obvious to me that what we need are sources of news that have interests more in tune with us; and when I say us, I mean to say us average human beings…mortals who daily go into the world to seek our fortunes and must take what we find for sustenance along with all the other people of planet Earth. I most vehemently do not include the sort of rabid greed-heads who control the corporations, the vicious fang-snapping vermin who pay themselves 165 Million in bonuses with one hand, while grabbing 175 Billion out of the pockets of everyone else! No, we need news that does NOT originate with THEM, and does not kow-tow to THEIR profits above our well-being! So let us keep that straight when we think about where our news should come from and who it is supposed to serve. If a technical means could be devised - and we are seeing some examples along the lines of DIGG - by which local tidbits of information are posted, then evaluated, then aggregated upwards into an editorial process, I think we would be on the right track. There will be no way to replace the journalist, ultimately, but there need not be a patent claimed on the act of journalism. Members of our own communities can contribute, activists can contribute, as well as academics, analysts, and utterly biased idiots. What we need is a way for the stories to be aggregated into streams relevant to particular segments of the population. The contamination of peanuts in Georgia warehouses is important to Americans about to consume the peanut butter made from those peanuts, but this news may not be useful to a fisherman on the Goa coast of India. On the other hand, a breached hull of a passing Exxon tanker off the west coast of India would be extremely important to our fisherman! The crime of the current system, is that AP feeds balderdash into the headlines of every news outlet in the world, and editors &#8212; some I know personally to be absolutely prostrate ass-kissers of warmongers &#8212; sprinkle this stream of junk with tidbits of possibly salient local items, on the order of “High School girls have car wash.” This is insane. It is clear to everyone, that newspapers hung themselves by being willing slaves to the highest bidder, just like our government. What we need are more realistic means of channeling info into local &gt; regional &gt; national &gt; global aggregations based on LOCATION, on TIME, and THEMATIC metadata. The people who will end up saving us are not the ham-fisted Mafia of Howard Berman, who would outlaw breathing of air if it could sell more CD’s for Time-Warner, but instead they will be the metadata librarians and the experts of Knowledge Organization Systems. They are the ones who can help us to automatically, stream, sort, and retrieve information streams as they are being generated. A Twitter # hash is not going to work.","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"},{"name":"journalism","slug":"journalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/journalism/"}]},{"title":"March of the Robots in the Uncanny Valley","slug":"march-of-the-robots","date":"2009-03-13T20:03:07.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"MACHINES/march-of-the-robots/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/MACHINES/march-of-the-robots/","excerpt":"Although the armatures and servo-controlled eyeballs beneath the skin may be fascinating, Beware the Ides of March, and robot teachers with scary rubber lips!

In the photo series that appeared in the Boston Globe recently, it was apparent to me that loose rubber lips do not a rose make.

Still, it is interesting to ponder that gap in the Uncanny Valley, where corpses, zombies, and prosthetic hands live. It is comforting to know that, Masahiro Mori, in his hypothesis on the Uncanny Valley, placed Bunraku Puppets much closer to normal human beings…much closer than corpses and zombies. And yet, what of the humans who operate the Bunraku Puppets? The master puppeteers who show their faces while working the strings, and their small band of black-clad ninja assistants, who move around the performance like whisps of silent smoke. Aren’t those humans rather uncanny? Where would they fit along the scale? I’d put them someplace closer to prosthetic hands than the puppets themselves.","categories":[{"name":"MACHINES","slug":"MACHINES","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/MACHINES/"}],"tags":[{"name":"psychology","slug":"psychology","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/psychology/"},{"name":"robotics","slug":"robotics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/robotics/"}]},{"title":"Galileo vs. the Church:  arent we past the Inquisition, yet?","slug":"galileo-vs-the-church-arent-we-past-the-inquisition-yet","date":"2009-03-12T02:29:21.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T01:18:32.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/galileo-vs-the-church-arent-we-past-the-inquisition-yet/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/galileo-vs-the-church-arent-we-past-the-inquisition-yet/","excerpt":"Sophia and I were lucky last night because our friend, MaryAnn, scored some great tickets to the Preview show of “Two Men of Florence,” the first play by Richard Goodwin.

Let me see if I can peek beneath the hem of your borrowed radiance.’ The vocabulary and clear enunciation combine for an enjoyable story, which gradually builds up the tension until the character of Pope finally snaps and decides to destroy all of the scientist’s published works. Galileo, in order to save his own life, capitulates to the Inquisitor, but in the final confrontation between the two men he still defends his own view which is that the science of logic and reason are not inimicable to his own faith. But the Pope, furious at the thought that he has let a genii out of the bottle demands that Galileo repent his ideas. “Would you erase men’s minds?” Galileo laments. “Yes, if I can,” replies the Pope, “if it is not too late.” But this brings up my only criticism of the play, namely that it is certainly too late! Have we not had enough of the idiotic belief systems of ancient times, throttling and strangling scientific progress? Weren’t the 1,000 years of the Dark Ages enough, the Inquisition enough, the 400 years that it took the Church to apologize for the treatment of Galileo enough? Isn’t it, in fact, far too late to be arguing these points? As the world of humans &#8212; a ravenous lot of greedy pigs &#8212; goes on destroying the resources and very planet that we need for survival, haven’t we had time to get past all of this belly-aching and agonizing over what the Pope thinks? Well, don’t let this put you off the play; it really is terrific and you should see it if you have the chance! Indeed, the evidence of my reaction is enough to demonstrate that Goodwin’s script is a success, for it is only designed to bring out debate on these topics of belief and of reason, which is a good thing. I just can’t help but gripe about the fact that mindless, uncomprehending adherents have so gummed up the works of our nation and its progress, that the President actually has to sign executive orders demanding that religious beliefs not interfere with the conduct of scientific research! As if such a thing is not totally obvious, not completely necessary, not elementary to any real grasp of the mess we are in to begin with… But there you have it, a wonderful play for the cogniscenti to tittle over and to remark upon over the tinkling ice of their highballs… when what we really need is something like Marat / Sade!

These sculptures date back to the late 19th Century, and seem to ramble up and down the walls like characters in a mad cartoon. Some have the extended legs of storks, while others reach across the room like Plastic Man. Most of them have absurdly long eyebrows (sign of longevity and wisdom), shaved heads, and bony figures. And all of them have amusing details in vivid color, including robes, walking sticks, beads, sandals, and sacred relics. In one of the smaller halls there remain a few of the lohan sculptures from an earlier incarnation of the temple (which has burned down many times during the last 1,000 years). These older lohan are much more serene and minimalist, giving us pause to wonder about the practicioners who made the long journey to those quiet hills centuries ago. Before the temple became a carnival of goofy caricatures, those older lohan retain a deep peacefulness in their features.

The tributes and obits are flowing in from all corners of society. SF Site has posted a great 1975 interview conducted in Minneaopolis by Dave Truesdale, (editor of Tangent fanzine), which primarily deals with the identity of Kilgore Trout. Not the fictional Kilgore Trout who appeared in Vonnegut’s Breakfast of Champions, but the author Kilgore Trout, who wrote Venus on the Half-Shell, which was published as a serial in F&amp;SF in Dec 1974 - Jan 1975, then picked up as a mass market paperback by Dell. At the time, there was intense speculation among SF fans about the true identity of Kilgore Trout, shown above at his typewriter on the back cover of the Dell paperback. Who was that weird beard? And how the heck did his whiskers manage to grow up, around, and on top of his nose? This mystery fascinated me, both for the absurd photo and the absurdity of the fictional character coming to life to write his own hilarious in-character novel. It was not simply a gag, either. When the word finally leaked out that, in fact, it was Philip Jose Farmer who wrote the book &#8212; not Vonnegut &#8212; it made perfect sense, because Farmer was noted for his amazing ability to research the styles and sensibilities of fictional characters created by other writers and to breathe new life into them in his own works. When I found out that Venus on the Half Shell was by the same author as Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod, my respect for Farmer shot up into orbit. And it never came down, either! How ironic that Jungle Rot Kid (a tale of Tarzan as if written by William S. Burroughs instead of Edgar Rice Burroughs) first appeared in the popular music and culture zine, Broadside (vol4 no2, 1968) with a semi-sleazy cover, reminiscent of the skin mags that supposedly were the publishers of Kilgore Trout’s own novels. The amazing thing to me about Farmer is that he can deftly weave his way into the consciousness of a character, almost effortlessly, and reveal the thoughts and emotions of that character exactly the way you would have expected it to be. This was by no means an accident! Farmer went to enormous lengths to research his subjects, going so far as to actually meet the real Lord Graystoke in his pursuit of Tarzan’s psyche. The result was his biography of the fictional character, Tarzan, Tarzan Alive. Farmer went on to use the same technique in Doc Savage, his Apocalyptic Life, for which he re-read 150 consecutive Doc Savage pulps! The visualization of both real and fictional people, who have some notoriety in culture or history, was one of the constant themes of Farmer’s writing style, carrying on through his entire Riverworld series.

This exhibit kicked off two years ago at the Yerba Buena Center of the Arts, and has been making the rounds from city to city, and finally seems to have drifted into Boston on a Greyhound bus, clutching an old leather bag of 78s and sinsemilla buds. What impressed me about the Mass Art show was that it lacked some of the color pieces and big sculptures featured at other venues and was almost exclusively focused on lush black and white original pen and ink drawings, together with a big cabinet full of Crumb’s spool heads. The exhibit opened with some early pages from Fritz the Cat, including a hilarious bathtub orgy scene, which was straight of the the Marx Brothers Night at the Opera. Nearby was one of the earliest Angelfood McSpade stories, and the original drawing of HEAD, a sort of infinitely fractalized series of pipes and wires shown in the cutaway view of a doper’s head: a tinhorn amplifier for an ear, a camera and flashbulb for an eye, a dripping faucet for a nostril. The care and precision of the inking on these works is amazing, and in some cases is combined with incredibly bold composition, such as the EVO cover shown above: Burned Out! This amazing piece was drawn and inked on a sheet of graph paper, a wild homage to Basil Wolverton, rendered in flawless black cross-hatching. Other EVO covers, and unpublished covers were arranged among whole pages of original comics, featuring the Hairy Hippies, Mr. Natural, occasional snoids and funny animals…but sadly lacking Flakey Foont. Some of the most fascinating pieces to gaze at were the Zap Comics Jam pages, on which the whole lot of mad artists drew bits and pieces together. With Crumb injecting his usual devil ladies, S. Clay Wilson providing pirates and demons, Victor Moscoso warping the page into perspectives of floating blobs and deranged mice, Gilbert Shelton doing his dopers and cops, Spain Rodriquez spanning a page with tightly integrated cubist patterns, Rick Griffin edging in some sharp edged electricity and bugs, while Brian Williams gets lost in the details. Amazing stuff! Another interesting collaboration was a page of Snappy Sammy Smoot, with some Crumb figures appearing with Jay Lynch’s bizarre zoot-suited wierdo and Skip Williamson’s grimacing caricatures. The crowning moment of the show is definitely the looped video of an old film taken of the entire Zap Comix gang as they collaborated on a jam called “Science Fiction Comics.” The whole Zap crew listed in the previous paragraph, plus Harvey Kurtzman, are seen arriving, goofing around, drinking beer, chewing on turkey legs, flipping off the camera, gesturing at rows of buttons from elbow to wrist (yeah, S. Clay Wilson!), sketching original art, and pasting up the panels for camera ready art. This strange gem of historical footage has to be seen to be believed. If you ever wondered about the verisimilitude of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, look no further than Gilbert Shelton hamming it up. One really hopes that this video will surface on YouTube someday, and not be lost to the art exhibit limbo that gobbled up the brilliant “Vanishing Point” video I saw at the Baja to Vancouver exhibit several years ago. The sketches of R. Crumb, unlike many of the fine art we see in museums, does not hide our subconscious in depths of metaphorical bullshit. When he draws Jumping Jack Flash, he turns a sadistic cult leader into a maniacal, murdering necrophiliac…with nothing left to imagine. Sick? Wierd? Fetishistic? Yeah, well, if we were more honest about ourselves, then there would be more work like R. Crumb in the world. As it is, we have only him, a unique genius of pen and ink.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"comics","slug":"comics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/comics/"},{"name":"drugs","slug":"drugs","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/drugs/"},{"name":"rebellion","slug":"rebellion","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/rebellion/"},{"name":"artists","slug":"artists","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/artists/"},{"name":"society","slug":"society","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/society/"},{"name":"underground","slug":"underground","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/underground/"}]},{"title":"Yuantong Si, Kunming, 1990","slug":"yuantong-si-kunming-1990","date":"2009-02-23T03:11:18.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:33:20.000Z","comments":true,"path":"TRAVELS/yuantong-si-kunming-1990/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/TRAVELS/yuantong-si-kunming-1990/","excerpt":"On my first trip to China, in October of 1990, I entered from Hong Kong by rail to Guangzhou Station, then bought a ticket on a flight to Kunming for the following morning.

I was staying at the Camelia Hotel , then a backpacker’s paradise, with a huge co-ed dormitory and easy access to various transportation routes. At that time, the entire Hong Kong women’s volleyball team was staying there, after having competed in the 1990 Asian Games. What a deliriously stimulating dorm room that was! I can recall stumbling out of the hotel and walking westward through the center of Kunming along Dongfeng Lu, stopping frequently to absorb the sights, sounds, and smells of that great melting pot of a city. My first nourishment was a big bowl of mixian topped with bits of deep fried garlic and tiny cubes of dried horse meat. Eventually I found Cuihu park , where I listened to folk songs in various non-Chinese languages, and then wandered vaguely back to the east side of Kunming along Yuantong Jie. On the way, I discovered the very first Chinese Buddhist temple that I ever visited, Yuantong Si . The gate ticket that I saved (see scan above), became the cornerstone of a gate ticket collection that has since swelled to fill a fat envelope . So this will be the first blog post in a series about the various temples, museums, and sites of interest that I have visited in China, Japan, Taiwan, and India. At the time of my first visit, Yuantong Si was somewhat forlorn. I was able to spend a long time at the concession stand looking at every single print and trinket that they had without anyone else around. Little did I know that the temple was established more than 1,000 years earlier, and was at times an important center for Ch’an practice and at other times a rooming house for French Imperialists. The central pavilion, which sits in between two ponds and is accessed by beautiful stone bridges in front and back, was locked up, and the incense braziers in front of the main hall were only burning a few handfuls of red-stemmed joss. When I next visited Yuantong Si (in 1993), I happened to arrive on a festival day. During the intervening three years, a Buddhist revival had been slowly gaining ground, and it was quite interesting to see the courtyard full of visitors conducting all sorts of rites that had almost nothing to do with one another. Here someone was bringing a basket of fruit for the shrine, there someone was lighting a whole bundle of joss sticks at once, creating a giant flame. In the middle of this were people doing prostrations to the four directions, while mobs of day-trippers and children wandered aimlessly, or stood gawking at the practitioners. By 1997, when I next visited the temple, renovations had been made to the complex, including the installation of a multi-armed Kuanyin figure, and lines of people made their way to the braziers to burn incense and bow three times to the Buddha hall. My visits to Yuantong Si, then, were a sort of microcosm of the Buddhist revival that has taken place in China over the last twenty years. What a nice place to start my career of temple hopping, and how lucky I was!

Who would have thought that an urban planning talk &#8212; stoked with dire warnings and gloomy facts &#8212; would bring out such a vibrant cross-section of the city? It is almost as if, after thirty years of vapid hand-wringing and self-gratifying acts of “green” living, the mass of architects, planners, designers, and technocrats are beginning to realize that if they do not actually change the way America is built starting immediately, that our cities are literally going to fall apart. Cities can only take so much pillaging by the greed heads, then they go belly up. It’s not as if we did not see this coming. It’s been like a runaway train that travels at one-millionth the pace of a snail. Since the ecology movement of the 1970s and the brief moment of hope for alternative energies and sustainable development that blossomed after the oil shock, we fell into the truly insane frenzies of Reaganomics and Supply Side Economics. Is that era finally over? The financial mess we are in today seems to indicate that it is…but what will take it’s place? Into this vacuum steps the formidable architect, Di Mambro, who points out that our future cities will either be collapsed cities, resilient cities, divided cities, or ecotopias. We are already living in an age of collapsed cities: Detroit, Gary, Haverhill… pardon me if I didn’t name your collapsed hometown! As James Howard Kunstler has been warning us in his excellent books [Geography of Nowhere, The Long Emergency], “_Weâ€™re literally stuck up a cul - de - sac in a cement SUV without a fill-up_.” Di Mambro predicts that, the way things are going, we are very unlikely to end up in an ecotopia city, where humans and the natural environment are harmonized, where our energy use is ratcheted down to a sane level, and where sustainability is possible. On the contrary, he predicts that we will end up in divided cities, where small pockets of perfection exist for the super-rich, while the mass of humanity toils in unworkable filth on all sides. Who is to blame for this state of affairs? Di Mambro says his own generation did not fulfil its obligations for stewardship. But also to blame are the basic tenets of the 20th century; that growth is equal to progress, and that technology will solve everything. We need to balance growth and development with rational methods for preserving our air, water, and soil so that their carrying capacity comes back into line with our population. But the trends do not look good. In fact, we have an automobile industy in total denial, and burgeoning populations along the coastlines in the face of rising waters…we are in for a right awful mess! Di Mambro did offer some concrete ideas for what we have to do, but he stressed that this is not a design issue, nor is it a choice. Our backs are already to the wall and it is now long past the point where hesitation is acceptable. Only serious action, vigilance, advocacy, and a unified society will be able to transform our dysfunctional urban - suburban axes of evil into liveable habitats. The sad thing to me about this situation, is that all of these so-called planners and architects have been reading the works of Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford for forty years! Why did they wait until the situation deteriorated to this point before coming out in huge numbers to applaud Di Mambro? Where was their spine over the last three decades when I was out raving against the supremacy of the automobile, against the madness of suburban sprawl, against the rape of our wetlands and trashing of our forests? Will the plan that Di Mambro advocates for South Dallas be acted upon, or just shelved along with all our good intentions as the ship sinks? Even as Di Mambro’s animated historical maps showed the highways snaking through the center of South Dallas, gutting neighborhoods and turning them into wastelands of scrap metal yards and born-again churches, I suspect that the malaise is somehow more deeply entwined with our automobile-based economy than any planners can fix. It’s not that I don’t respect what Di Mambro is trying to do, don’t get me wrong: the man is a hero! But when he brokered a deal between the resident’s advocacy groups and the municipal government of Dallas, the “Memorandum of Understanding” was refused by the city officials because “we don’t have those kind of words down here in Dallas…“ As Di Mambro said of the deal the city first proposed for South Dallas: “it smells a rat!“ And that pretty much sums up my feeling for what we will get from any Bechtel, from any Parsons-Brinkerhoff, from any Bovis, until we hog-tie the bastards who have stolen all the public wealth for the last forty years and get our money back! The way in which we built our cities in the first place is now strangling us with our own idiocy. _See also unrelated talk by Di Mambro on urban planning in Boston and Italy: 16 minute video [Di Mambro talk begins at 30:00, ends at 46:30]_","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"futurism","slug":"futurism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/futurism/"},{"name":"habitats","slug":"habitats","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/habitats/"},{"name":"architecture","slug":"architecture","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/architecture/"},{"name":"new urbanism","slug":"new-urbanism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/new-urbanism/"}]},{"title":"Science Fiction Artists Are In the House &#8212; Boskone 2009 con report (part one)","slug":"science-fiction-artists-are-in-the-house-boskone-2009-part-one","date":"2009-02-17T06:42:26.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/science-fiction-artists-are-in-the-house-boskone-2009-part-one/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/science-fiction-artists-are-in-the-house-boskone-2009-part-one/","excerpt":"This year’s Boskone had a stellar line-up of artists, including the likes of Donato Giancola, Daniel Dos Santos, Omar Rayyan, Dave Seeley, Bob Eggleton, Ruth Sanderson, Alan Beck, Margaret Organ-Kean, Stephan Martiniere (Artist GOH), and others!

Considering next year’s slated Arist GOH is John Picacio, things are still looking pretty good… The graphic novels panel on Friday night delved into the subject of sequential art and what unique aspects the medium has in comparison to literature and cinema. The consensus seemed to be that comics and sequential art occupy a special space in the reader’s brain, involving both the right and left lobes. This is due to the simultaneous apprehension of both the word and image. Unlike film, which is almost by necessity carrying the viewer’s attention with constant motion, the comics medium offers a series of freeze frames that can be either minimalist studies or packed with incredible detail. The reader of comics can speed through the panels or linger over them as they wish, unlike watching a film, in which the pace is set (sometimes in beautiful way, sometimes in a nauseating way) by the director. The session called “Evolution of a Drawing,” was incredible, featuring Donato Giancola sketching on earth tone paper with red pencil and white chalk pencil, and Dan Dos Santos ripping through a composition on a digital tablet. As if watching a tennis match, the audience found themselves turning back an forth from one artist to the other, as they explained the steps involved in producing a prepatory sketch. Donato explained that using the earth tone paper had the advantage of serving as mid-tone over which he could sculpt the shadows and outlines with red, then pop out the highlights with just a few strokes of white chalk. Using white paper, by contrast, required stepping down the entire sketch in value to get away from the white, which would end up brighter than the highlights. He also said the sketches sell for more money, since they look so classic! Dos Santos showed, with an ease of technique that was deceptively simple looking, how to work directly in Photoshop using standard brushes and filters. Dos Santos worked completely in grayscale, working up the tone of the composition with a constant sweeping of brush and eraser tools; the advantage of avoiding color being that once the black and white sketch has been saved, various color schemes can be tried out and deleted one after another, until finding the one he likes. Also on Friday was the panel session on the “Uncanny Valley“, that part of our satisfaction with robots that drops-off suddenly when something creepy or strange about them bothers us. The subject seemed sure to set off fireworks among the panelists, among them Charles Stross, James Patrick Kelley, Allen Steele, and Paul Melko. Steele, amazingly, managed to stray from the Uncanny Valley topic to stories about dwarves inside of 19th-Century poker playing mechanical Turks, not once, but twice! Stross sat silently through the dwarf stories, looking at times as if he was choking on gristle, and then pointed out that the concept of the Uncanny Valley is more than likely a direct parallel of racism, if not a form of racism. Steele did not agree and asked for an explanation. Stross didn’t answer. Melko explained the analogy to Steele, in terms of the historical sense of doubting those who are not of one’s own tribe, who are different, and Other, hence subject to suspicion. James Patrick Kelley, accused of being a silent robot at his end of the table, had an amusing malfunction during which his notebook and pen went flying out of his hands and he slid out of his chair. Then he rose to suggest that robots have often been used in SF as surrogate slaves, because one of the most basic human traits is the desire to completely dominate someone else. Now that human beings have become too civilized to dominate one another, SF has turned to robots, androids, &amp; simulacra to serve as slaves. An audience member objected to the amalgamation of racism and slavery in the discussion, since slavery historically is not always racist in nature. For some reason, nobody objected to this argument on the grounds that there is no rule about discussing the topic from more than one aspect at a time… Then, strangely, Steele began to tell an anecdote about Susan Sarandon’s voice emanating from the self-serve checkout lane computer at his local supermarket. On that note, the topic was officially pronounced dead. At the Art Show reception there was a tremendous array of cakes, a bar, and a band playing some pretty decent jazz. In the center of the reception area was a gigantic NESFA freebie table of duplicate SF magazines. There was also a large table containing chocolates of different sizes, shapes, colors and ingredients. The extra delicious items may have been in honor of Jane Yolen, celebrating her 70th birthday. Happy Birthday, Jane, and many more! Saturday morning there was a panel called “Stupid Art Tricks: shortcuts to take, traps to avoid,” featuring Dave Seeley, Bob Eggleton, and Dan Dos Santos. Seeley started off by saying that taking the synopsis from the publisher too literally is a trap. Dos Santos said that, in his case, he tends to agonize too much about the three quick sketches he sends in, because he will be stuck painting one of them for two to three weeks straight. He also said that he doesn’t talk to authors about the painting, because they will call him up and say, “oh, I just added a tomb to the story, can you paint that in?” Eggleton said that one trap is running out of time by accepting too many jobs at once. “Since we don’t know from day to day if we will ever work again, we take everything that comes in the door. But then we have this horrible mountain of a backlog to work through.” Seeley said that one pitfall is to send out a preliminary or an underpainting to the publisher, who puts it into their catalog before the final painting is done. That image sometimes gets picked up by Amazon.com or trade journals and ends up floating around, instead of the actual finished piece. Dos Santos warned: “never show the art director your photo references! They’ll see a photo and ask you to redo the color or the angle of somebody’s nose!” Seeley advised artists not to directly rip off others, but to use photo reference when they paint &#8212; “some people just scan others work and then paint over them. It may be expedient but you’ll become a pariah among other artists if you do that. On the other hand, many people don’t understand how ubiquitous the use of photo reference is in the field of commercial illustration. So the best art trick is to use good photo references. The trap is to follow photo reference too religiously. Especially with action figures…your eyeball has a way it expects figures to look, even though the poses aren’t completely realistic.” Dos Santos said that he sketches from his imagination first, then takes his own photo reference images to match the figures. Sometimes the photos have to be stretched or warped to fit the dynamic poses that he created in the imaginary sketches. Eggleton said that he’ll paint some studies from landscape photos to get the mood and atmosphere of the setting. Then he puts the reference photos away and goes into the painting according to his own ideas. “That surreal space in between photo reference and imagination is where I capture the look,” said Eggleton. One question from the audience was, “when do you know a piece is done?” Seeley said that “as soon as I start a piece, I start fixing it. When is the fixing done?! Even a year later, I’ll pull something out of the rack and say to myself I need to fix that some more!” Dos Santos comment: “For me I know I’m done after a painting is sold. Once someone else owns it is nice because I know I can’t touch it anymore! But then, I’ll see one of my old paintings and notice some detail and go: why’d I do that?!“ The panel called “SF, the Fragmented Genre,” took on the problem of the hydra-headed monster that SF- Fantasy has become. Moderator, Peter J. Heck, started off by saying that some thirty years ago, a reader might feasibly be able to keep abreast of the major publications in the field of SF and Fantasy. But, today, after decades of fragmentation, the genre has matured to the point that a reader who is dedicated to a particular sub-genre (romantic fantasy, or military SF), could happily stick within their own niche and have plenty to read. Indeed, it is no longer possible to actually read all the publications in the field as a whole. Even a single publisher, like Tor books, will release 400 titles a year. The editor of Tor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, picked up the thread to say that there are some successful sub-genres and some less successful ones. Splatterpunk, he contended, was the invention of three authors, and had no legs to stand on. On the other hand, occasionally an SF sub-genre will take off and go mainstream, as was the case with Steampunk. Eleanor Wood chimed in to say that “the real question should be not what sub-genre a book fits into, but rather: is it fast-paced? do I care? Some books don’t fit easily into any genre, but that shouldn’t detract from their value. For example, Dune went to 21 publishers in a row, and was rejected by all of them. Eventually it was published by Chilton [better known for auto repair manuals than SF]. So when there isn’t a frame of reference as a precedent, books in new genres or sub-genres are hard to publish”. PNH said that “there are cases in which sub-genres emerge out of SF into the mainstream, like Steampunk, or individual books end up getting published as mainstream fiction that originated in SF circles. Vonda McIntyre tells the story of a participant in one of her workshops who contacted her a year later and said that she had sold her first novel, but could only get $100,000 advance for it. The writer was Jean Auel and the book, Clan of the Cave Bear. Hearing this, Vonda wanted to put a gun to her head….[since that was probably ten times more than the highest paid SF writer would get].” Peter Heck said that despite mistakes and ambiguities in how books get categorized, the process isn’t completely arbitrary because it does convey some useful information to the readers. PNH: “You wouldn’t want to go into a bookstore and find everything lumped together in one giant category. It helps to have some categories. That doesn’t mean that a book has to necessarily fit into a particular genre. There are great books that could be sold in several categories. But there are some hideous contortions that occur when books are packaged. One of my favorite hobbies is to go into the bookstore and try to imagine the dialog of the editorial meeting where a particularly terrible packaging decision was made.” An audience member suggested that it would be great if a book didn’t have to have a single category, but instead could be tagged with different user preference rankings, similar to the Amazon.com system of &#8216;other people who bought this book, also bought…’ PNH agreed, “it would be great if those rankings were stored as tags in an RFID chip on each book. The customer then walks down the shelf until his smartphone begins chiming to indicate that a book has matched enough of the category tags that he previously selected as his preferences. I need to patent that.” In the art show, the eternally creepy and amusing Charles Lang, presented a sculpture consisting of six soup cans stacked three, two, one, in a pyramid. The packaging of the soup cans were similar to Campbell’s Soup, except that the portrait on the cartouche in the center of the gold band was that of H.P. Lovecraft. This was H. P. Lovecraft’s brand, consisting of the following delicacies: **Cream of Cthulhu Soup The Old Ones Stew Shoggoth Broth Yog-Sothoth Rice Soup Cream of Fungi from Yuggoth Soup Gug Noogle Soup** The can on the top of the pyramid was pried open a crack and green tentacles were oozing out of it!

It occurs to me that even without touching on the teachings themselves, just a brief note on the course of events might be an amusing trip for those of us who took similar journeys, or who might not have been born yet. Even before I knew what meditation was, I had been very fortunate to know Kim An Wang, who was my Mother’s yoga instructor in Chicago during the 1960s. Kim is too complicated a character to describe here, but let me just say that he taught me the basic sun worship (soorya namaskar) when I was all of 6 years old. It was not something I practiced regularly then, but in 1971, when I first began to participate in the youth soccer league, I found that the yoga routine was much better for me than the harsh calisthenics proscribed by the coach. Hatha Yoga, then, is probably the first form of meditation that I encountered in this lifetime, and for nearly forty years has been my single most consistent form of practice. My earliest memory of sitting meditation goes back to visiting to the Golden Temple ashram in Espanola, New Mexico some time around 1973 or 74. This trip would have been made with my Mother who drove me up there with my sister Chiyoko. I don’t remember much about what was going on, except that everyone had long hair and dressed in spotless white clothes. I was very impressed with the neatly wrapped white turbans and the mad looking beards the men wore. At that time, the compound consisted of a house and some ramshackle dwellings, along with tents and gardens and animals wandering around. I can’t remember anything about the meditation practice, except that everyone was very serious about it, despite the seeming anarchy of the living conditions. But I do remember that we all shared a big pot of zucchini stew for dinner. I don’t even know if Yogi Bhajan was there or not, and it was decades later that I associated the place in my memory with the famous organization 3HO and Yogi Tea. My next encounter with meditation would have been visiting a branch of Yogananda’s Self Realization Fellowship in Phoenix, Arizona, around 1975. I recall being very skeptical of this place at first, because of the portraits of various figures on the walls, including Jesus. But the actual meditation there was basically a quiet sitting session, with no instruction, no preaching, and no expectations. It was completely hassle-free and dogma neutral. Considering that my mother had also enrolled me in a Scientology course the same year (which turned into an extremely negative disaster)… the Fellowship was a refreshingly good vibe. Right around the same time, I was discovering J.R.R.Tolkien (thanks to the famous Ballantine reprints), so the whole idea of Fellowships among seekers, was all the more interesting. Parenthetically, I ought to mention my experience with Scientology, which consisted of exactly two one-hour-long sessions. During the first, I was given clay and told to mold it into the image of my theta. I was also given some sort of extremely bizarre pep-talk about the nature of my past lives and how, thanks to the brilliant genius of L. Ron Hubbard, I was going to free myself of the bad elements of my psyche, escape my reactive mind, and become “clear.” The fact that this talk was far from clear, even in the most mundane sense, and actually bordered on the incomprehensible ravings of a schizophrenic did not seem to faze the speaker to the tiniest degree. Finally, the session was capped off with the class rising to salute the photo portrait of L. Ron Hubbard. It was at that point, in the first session, that I balked. I simply refused to salute anyone’s portrait, especially that seedy looking idiot in a white Captain’s hat with little gold braids over the brim. The only authority figure that I will salute in this Universe is Bullwinkle the Moose, in his persona of Mr. Know-it-all… because he is the only authority figure I know of who can completely embrace his own ignorance and, at the same time, still be amusing without expecting any allegiance whatsoever. In any case, I walked out on the unbelieving group &#8212; how could I be such an ignorant, obtuse, and insubordinate ass to the people trying to help me?! &#8212; and was determined to never go back. Needless to say, my Mother somehow made me feel so damned guilty about the $10 she spent on the tuition, that I decided to go back to the second session just to demand the money back. That proved to be a big mistake. The Scientologists, it turns out, have procedures for dealing with people like me! When I said that I was only interested in getting my money back because saluting a photo was not my idea of learning anything, they sent me out of the group session into a little room with the auditor. This creepy lunatic assured me that he was only going to give me an “exit interview” to find out why I didn’t like the course. What this turned out to be, however, was something more akin to a psychological Spanish Inquisition, designed specifically to turn me into the most fucked up, self-hating creature imaginable. The guy made me hold two tin cans, connected by a wire to an e-meter. This preposterous contraption, supposedly sensitive to my psychic vibrations, was the most overt psychological control and conditioning device I have ever seen. Fortunately I can’t remember the substance of what we said, but I do remember finally tossing those cans down and saying that they should send me my money back. Walking out on those freaks was an important lesson in dealing with cults, dealing with the control mechanisms that are built in to our seemingly “free” and innocuous society. So I offer it here as a sort of anti-meditation lesson, namely: stay away from people who try to pin you down with love you / hate you control scenarios, they are evil, manipulative bastards. A lot of people could save themselves from lifetimes of mental torture, cult deprogramming, and self-hatred if they would just follow that simple bit of advice. Next on my list of meditation attempts, would be sitting with the Zen Practice group at the Living Batch Bookstore, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This would have been in 1976, I believe. By that time, I had pretty much figured out that my Mom’s advice on mystical and religious pursuits, including her tries to interest me in the Essenes, sproutarianism, Arnold Ehret’s Mucouslous Diet, Crystal Therapy, the Rosicrucians, Sikhism, Macrobiotics, wheatgrass, beet juice, etc were probably not going to work for me. I decided to branch out on my own, and almost immediately got interested in Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Why Zen? The eternal question. But in the words of Alan Watts, Does It Matter? In any case, I found myself sitting with the group, had my first encounter with Buddhist ideas, with basic meditation techniques, and with zabuton cushions. My early experience with Zen meditation was that is was confusingly difficult. The more I tried it, the more I felt physical discomfort and mental stress. Wasn’t Zen supposed to make my mind clear? All it did was muddle it up with random chatter. Since there was no real teacher among the group, I never got beyond the feeling that I was doing it wrong, and soon gave up. From there I went into a period of years much more devoted to Western philosophy and to meditation as a sort of cogitation on rational objects and ideas. Socrates, Aristotle, Camus and Mortimer Adler were my guides. Following my brief interlude with Zen practice I became interested in the works of Carlos Castenada, and his purported studies with the mystical gurus in the desert, Don Juan and Don Genero. These somehow fit in with the Mr. Natural guru type, which greatly appealed to my sense of what a real teacher must be like. This also, not surprisingly, corresponded with the time of my life when there was a great deal of pot-smoking and experimentation with mind-altering chemicals of one kind or another. Let’s just say that my mind was more in tune with the average lava lamp, then with the insights of a real teacher. When I moved to New York City in 1978, I almost immediately discovered Franklin Y.C. Kwong, who taught Tai Chi Ch’uan. Practicing Tai Chi twice every day, brought me a completely new awareness and energy. Not only did I find that I was suddenly more interested in the practice of the form itself, but also in the philosophical underpinnings. When Master Kwong invited me to join his Taoist meditation group in 1979, I jumped at the chance! We met in his uptown hi-rise apartment on the East Side, and practiced the cycling of ch’i and development of energy centers such as the triple burner and tan t’ien. I found this very fascinating. On the other hand, it was almost entirely abstract, which is to say that the methods were focused on an esoteric plane of endeavor, and had little to do with my daily life. As I mentioned in the previous post, it was around the same time (Winter of 1978-1979) that I first met Master Sheng Yen. From the very start, Sheng Yen plunged into the teaching of Ch’an meditation on the practical and philosophical levels. Not only that, but I discovered that Ch’an was not about any particularly esoteric concepts. Ch’an was focused simply and completely on your present state of consciousness and learning how to deal with it. At last I had found the right stuff! In 1980 I took an interesting college course on the history of Buddhism, taught by the inimitable Dr. Fred Underwood. One of my classmates was Chris Marano, who later became an editor for Dharma Drum Publications. Underwood would come to the class impeccably dressed, with hat, umbrella, three-piece tailored suit, and attache case engraved with his initials. He was equally well-prepared to lecture, and reeled off an amazing outline of Buddhism, from the Siddharta to Tantric practices, all the while lacing his monologues with fascinating insider’s jokes, traveler’s tales, and occasionally salacious gossip about famous scholars in pursuit of mystical knowledge. At the conclusion of the semester, Underwood promised to give a summary lecture to prepare us all for the final examination. The room was packed full of nervous Divinity School students, who had been more or less lost in the unfamiliar waters of that strange, pagan religion for all these weeks, and who waited with bated breath, sharpened pencils, and piles of lecture notes to get the answers to the coming exam. Underwood arrived, placed his bag on the floor next to the lectern, and told us a story: Once there was a new Buddhist temple to be dedicated. The major abbots of various sects were all gathered to make benedictory statements and blessings for the founding of the new temple. The Abbot of the Hinayana sect said - I bless this temple and wish that all disciples here may perfect their wisdom by working on deep meditation and achieve enlightenment. Then the Abbot of the Mahayana sect arose and went to the podium to say - I too give my blessings to the new temple and hope that all practicioners here will tirelessly help others and through loving kindess and compassion reach the state of true enlightenment. Finally the elderly Zen Abbot approached the podium leaning on his walking stick. When he faced the gathered crowd of Buddhists and well-wishers he said not a single word, but instead reached up and struck the podium three times with his stick, turned his back on them all, and walked away. While finishing this tale, Underwood had picked up his own umbrella, banged it sharply three times on the lectern, then reaching for his attache case, he marched straight out of the lecture hall. All of the students waited in silence for his reappearance, but only heard his footsteps fading away down the hall. Looks of confusion and exhasperation swept the audience. Finally two of the students, myself and Chris Marano, burst out laughing and picked up our satchels. Underwood was not coming back! He was finished with his summary. Indeed, the Divinity students all complained so vociferously against Underwood’s masterful lecture series and its concluding performance, that he was summarily sacked and never returned to teach again. I too, soon summed up my career as a college student, and left New York in 1981. During the 80s my meditation practice was centered on Tai Chi forms (including some techniques I picked up from Ben Porter (a student of gong-fu Master Charles Lin); and my first encounters with the Vajrayana teachings. During 1983-84, I built a small dojo and meditation studio using the planks from a burnt out saloon in an old garage on the corner of High Street and Silver Ave, in Albuquerque, which was called Wang Yue Shi æœ›æœˆå®¤ [Moon Viewing Studio]. I practiced Tai Chi there every day and did some sitting… mostly choking on dust and freezing. In 1984 I moved to Woodstock, New York and visited the lamas at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra on Mount Overlook. I wasn’t there to study, but to pick up my half-brother, Sangpo, from the living quarters where the lamas would look after him during the day one or two days a week. All I can say is that there were some very weird events taking place in the community around the KTD during the time of its establishment, which I can only describe as spooky, unexplainable, supernatural. This prevented me from taking any great interest in the pujas or other teachings going on there. During the late 1980s, I attended some public teachings in the Boston - Cambridge area, notably one event at the lecture hall in 2 Divinity Ave led by the Taiwanese nun Suma Ching Hai. Her teaching was flamboyantly fake, as she “channeled” messages from outer space, or someplace on the other side of the Dharmadhatu. As much as I enjoyed being in the audience of eager believers, I found myself all the more centered on my own sketchy and unproductive practice, based on the bits and pieces of teaching gathered together from Master Sheng Yen and readings in books by Chang Chung Yuan, Charles Luk, Philip Jampolsky, John Blofeld and Heinrich Dumoulin. At the time of the first Gulf War (Jan 1991), I moved to Amherst, where I managed to complete my degree in Chinese, with many thanks to my mentor, Al Cohen. With my degree in Chinese in hand, I moved to Beijing in the summer of 1992. There I visited one temple after another, listening to the chanting of sutras and to occasional teachings. My favorite temple was the Lama Temple, [Yonghegong], where an entire complex of Buddha halls is kept open as a functioning temple and tourist attraction. Under the awesome gaze of the giant sandalwood Maitreya, and marveling at the gold-encrusted human skulls (made into drums and drinking cups), I was reminded once again of my disinclination to get too deeply into tantric methods. But at the same time, visiting the Yonghegong once or twice a month, I began to get used to it, and even found myself meditating in the small Buddha hall at the northeast corner of the compound. Except for these meditations, and despite traveling far and wide to famous temples across China and Japan, I kept myself at a distance from religious practices, and did not participate directly in Buddhist practices while living in China, Japan, and Taiwan (between 1992 - 1998). Upon returning to the United States, I began to take more interest in meditation, visiting the Sanfo Temple of Central Square, Cambridge at the invitation of the Ven Nun Yifa around 2002. During those early years of the Bush - Cheney administration, I began to chafe at the Christian triumphalism that was somehow self-righteously claiming ascendency in the United States. At the same time that I wanted to avoid the tiresome explanations of why I was agnostic or atheistic or areligious, I began to convince my self that positive affirmation was a better idea. So it was that I came out of the closet as a Buddhist around 2004, began to wear fozhu, (which I had been secretly collecting during my travels), began to do prostrations at the Sanfo Buddha hall, and generally to focus more on the practice. Miraculously, as if in response to my decision, in 2005 when I traveled to Shanghai to participate in a conference, I was asked to go on a side-trip with some colleagues. Without any input from me, they selected the destination of Emei Shan in Sichuan, which happens to be one of the most famous Buddhist pilgrimage sites in China! Imagine my delight as a Buddhist practitioner… The entire trip became a pilgrimage: doing prostrations, participating in chanting, and sitting in quiet meditation whenever possible. Returning from the trip as a brazen, self-proclaimed Mahayana Buddhist, I began to look for a sangha to practice with. In 2006 I happened to hear a lecture, Taming the Drunken Elephant, by Trungram Gyaltrul Rimpoche, who struck me as quite similar to Master Sheng Yen, in some ways. For instance, Sheng Yen is famous for attaining a PhD in Buddhist studies in Japan before undertaking his career as a teacher of Ch’an. Rimpoche, who was raised an incarnate lama, had already begun teaching in his 20s, but then withdrew from active teaching in order to pursue a PhD in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies. Having finished this course of study, he once again began to teach Vajrayana meditation practice to small groups in Cambridge. And so my tale comes to the present day, since I continue to receive teachings from Rimpoche whenever possible, and to meditate with a small group of his students every week. You probably did not learn much by reading these notes on the chronology of my own experience of meditation studies, but I hope the journey has been amusing. Let me wish you well on your own adventures in meditation, and leave you with the same words that I gave to Chris Marano, when he set off to tramp across South America many years ago: **“Walk carefully and be aware of your steps, because the world is like a big old diamond, and your feet are diamond cutters!”","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Buddhism","slug":"Buddhism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/Buddhism/"},{"name":"consciousness","slug":"consciousness","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/consciousness/"}]},{"title":"So Long, Master Sheng Yen!","slug":"so-long-master-sheng-yen","date":"2009-02-04T04:35:48.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:28:42.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/so-long-master-sheng-yen/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/so-long-master-sheng-yen/","excerpt":"The parting message written by Master Sheng Yen to all of us: **Grown old while busy with trivial matters, Shedding tears and laughter over emptiness… But in the beginning there was no I, So birth and death can both be tossed aside.**","text":"The parting message written by Master Sheng Yen to all of us: **Grown old while busy with trivial matters, Shedding tears and laughter over emptiness… But in the beginning there was no I, So birth and death can both be tossed aside.** All those years ago, as I wandered the streets of New York in search of adulthood, in search of myself, in search of a circle of fast-talking whiskey-drinking writers and artists that would rage with me against the dark sky in mutual bewilderment… As a teenaged blunderkind I roamed the length of Manhattan in search of truth, in search of food for the soul, in search of beauty and poetry and unfettered freedom, in search of anything that could set my feet on a meaningful journey… and then, by pure chance, I stumbled into the realm of Ch’an Master Sheng Yen. Somehow I knew he was a true Zen master from the first moment that I heard him speak. And from the simple and yet often mischievous sparkle in his eyes, I knew that Shi-fu (as we called him) really had it! He knew exactly what those realms of satori and higher consciousness were, and he wanted to get us out of our self-deceiving funk to experience them for ourselves. If I had been a little older or wiser at the time I might have learned more. But then again, if I was a little older I might not have been so deeply affected by the teachings of Master Sheng Yen when he arrived in New York City. At first, there was a short series of teachings at Columbia Teacher’s College. Twenty people showed up the first night, but by the fourth session there were barely half a dozen of us left, sitting rigidly on the cold floor. One night, Sheng Yen slowly drew a chalk diagram of the seven states of Ch’an mind on the blackboard. If you studied with Sheng Yen Shi-fu, you no doubt will have heard him lecture on this topic. If not, you can probably get the general idea of what happens to your mental state as you progress through stages of calming down, concentration, mindfulness, and Ch’an. I still have the copy of that diagram that I scrawled onto the back of a name card, and have been striving to experience those states ever since… Some months later, we took over an old car repair shop, covered in grime and grease, and cleaned it up to serve as the first Ch’an Meditation Centre in Flushing Queens. (Today the Ch’an Centre is thriving in a much bigger location. ) I’ll never forget the time that Guoren Shi (Sheng Yen’s first American disciple) and I went to a carpet shop and Sheng Yen insisted on buying some rolled up remnants from a rack without even measuring them. We carried them up into the Meditation Center and tossed them into the two front rooms. Sheng Yen, watching us sardonically from the hallway shook his head and said, “No, you’ve got it backwards. Switch the carpets around.” Guoren Shi and I shrugged and swapped the rolled up carpets from one room to the other. Then we lined up one carpet along the wall of Shi-fu’s office room and snipped the strings with a pair of scissors. We gave the carpet a kick and it unrolled straight across the empty floor where the last bit flopped down exactly along the opposite wall! A sort of bolt of blue strangeness shot up our backs. How the heck did Sheng Yen know the remnant would fit perfectly - in that room, but not the other? After all, we hadn’t untied them or measured them in the carpet shop… With a strange foreboding of the inevitable we repeated the unrolling process with the other carpet and saw that it fit just as well as the first one. But when we turned around in amazement, Sheng Yen frowned at us. “Are you just going to stand there like bums,” he complained, “go wash the dishes!” Nonetheless, I’m convinced that there was a subtle smile on his face as we hurried down the hall. Another time, when we first began to clean the old repair shop, Shifu took me to the picture window downstairs and asked me to open up the old metal security grate that was spanning the window. I did that and we saw that the window was completely covered with grime and grease. It was a depressing sight. “I want you to clean that window up,” Shifu said. Then he took a single edge razor blade out of his sleeve where he had been hiding it and gave it to me. I looked at the tiny blade and then at the huge window and must have looked pretty forlorn, but I set to the task of cleaning it up. After many hours of scraping and wiping with rags, I finally had the full pane of glass cleaned up and spotless both inside and out. I was standing and admiring my work, when Shifu came in and asked me to get to work on the basement. Now what happened was, when I next came to the building about ten days later, somebody had painted the entire metal grate that covered the window with bright gold paint. Shifu asked me to take a look at it with him, then he asked me to open up the grate again. When I opened it, I discovered that the painter did not take any precaution to cover the glass window, which was now splattered with blobs of gold paint from top to bottom. My beautiful clean window! I turned around with a look of shock on my face. Shifu was only smiling at me for a moment, then he slowly took the razor blade back out of his sleeve, handed it to me, and walked away in silence. I was filled with surprise, frustration, and finally humor and burst out laughing. Then I set to work to scrape the whole window again! My stories of Sheng Yen are all like that, and there are many of them. I can’t believe that I only spent a few hours a week with him in 1979 and 1980. It seems as if he has always been with me, smacking me on the head when my focus began to fade, pointing at the Moon while I day-dreamed my life away, and admonishing me to work hard - work hard! - on my Ch’an practice. His parting words to me have been clicking in my mind for thirty years: Don’t be lazy, don’t be sad, don’t be angry, and don’t be proud. I thought of them as a special mantra, in addition to the kung-an he gave me to work on, and kept at them for decades. Long after I knew that it was the same exact admonition that Sheng Yen told everybody, I still somehow remembered it as if it was hand-crafted to my own “vast kharmic obstructions,” as he cheerfully used to call them. Every single one of us students got the same treatment, and a bunch of lazy good-for-nothings most of us were, who Sheng Yen constantly goaded towards the light. So long, Master Sheng Yen, we miss you already!

It’s absolutely shameful to think that the editors of major “news” services, such as AP and Reuters, or the made-men of the New York Times, Boston Globe, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post (etc) can even walk the streets without being pelted with rotten eggs and dog-shit!

Publishing some jingo-istic propaganda out of the Pentagon… covering up for the likes of Feith, Abrams, Cambone, Perle, Bolton, Libby, and the whole stinking crew of traitors… a fine lot of journalists they make! At least we had the likes of Truthout, Buzzflash, Common Dreams, and a thousand other mini-news feeds to sustain us through the darkest and bleakest of times. Nor should we, in celebrating the victory of reason over rampant red-faced psychosis, be complacent. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, to redefine our networks, and to move forward with new agendas for permaculture and sustainable development. Only a super-energized base of free wheeling, free thinking men and women will be able to defend our rights when those backstabbing zombies come back. And, no doubt about it, they will be back! Does Sarah Palin seem capable of understanding her own inadequacies? If the GOP can stand up a cynical snake-oil spewing cut-throat like W for President, what makes any of us think that they will hesitate to stoop even lower? For some historical perspective, let’s consider a few lines from Mungo’s highly entertaining book, and remember why it’s important to start something, and to light a fire under the establishment’s ass! “The great siege and elevation of the PentagonThe weekend of October 21st, 1967 was described the peace movement flyers as a “confrontation with the warmakers,” a noble pursuit. The Washington press waxed poetic about its concern for the dignity of the Federal monuments that these outsiders were certain to defile, if given a chance… The news broke that ten thousand troops were to be at the ready in nearby Fort Belvoir, Virginia… The government was preparing for the first time in decades for a serious threat to its Capitol, by its own citizens, over an unpopular war. The World War protesters, the bonus marchers, the 1963 civil rights march were not akin to this. This could only be compared to the burning of Washington in 1812. Marshall Bloom and I saw the Pentagon weekend as an excellent opportunity for the first meeting of the underground press, and we had for weeks been planning and advertising such a gathering, to be held at the Institute for Policy Studies… one of the few left-oriented research institutions in the nation. The meeting began in mid-afternoon Friday, October 20th, the day before the Pentagon confrontation… Marshall began to speak of the goals of the Liberation News Service to provide a link among the anti-establishment presses, to offer hard information to the Movement, etc, when the staff of the East Village Other [EVO], led by Walter Bowart in an Indian headdress, began a lengthy poem about the underground and an enthusiastic pitch for the fraternal order of the Underground Press Syndicate, which EVO directed. This brought Grossman and Stamberg of the Washington Free Press to their feet with charges of embezzlement against the Underground Press Syndicate and EVO. John Wilcock, publisher of Other Scenes, quickly corroborated that EVO was staffed by a pack of thieves. Before the issue could be resolved, however, Allen Cohen of San Francisco Oracle rose to read a poem, precipitating a lenghty East - West poetry competition between the New York Indian forces of EVO and the San Francisco Oracle Hari-Krishna heads. And so it went… The college editors were interested mostly in campus revolution, the pacifists in the war, the freaks in cultural revolution and cultural purity. The underlying buzz became a steady roar; Marshall burned his draft card, donned his Sgt. Pepper coat with epaulets and tails and quit the podium; a few fist fights broke out between warring factions of the anti-war forces; somebody shouted in regards to the organization of Liberation News Service “Do your thing, do your thing! If we like it, we’ll send you money when we can!” Our glorious scheme of joining together the campus editors, the Communists, the Trots, the hippies, the astrology freaks, the pacifists, the SDS kids, the black militants, the Mexican-American liberation fighters, and all their respective journals was reduced to ashes. Our conception of Liberation News Service as “democratic organization,” owned by those it served, was clearly ridiculous; among those it served were men whose very lives were devoted to the principle that no organization, no institution, was desirable… At any rate, it was clear on first meeting our constituency that Liberation News Service was to be an uneasy coalition.” &lt;p&gt; And today, my fine feathered and otherwise friends, we are no different. But we must at least try to reach out and forge new coalitions while we are still free to do so. Sure, they will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://la.indymedia.org/news/2007/05/198569_comment.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infiltrated and perverted&lt;/a&gt;, what else is new? So let us remember, in the seeming chaos of our conflicting interests: &lt;strong&gt;Do your thing, do your thing! If we like it, we&apos;ll send you money when we can!&lt;/strong&gt; Let that simple truth, which launched the Liberation News Service against impossible odds, take us where we need to go. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gmpfilms.com/NLF.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.yunchtime.net/misc/marshall_bloom.GIF&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://raymondmungo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.yunchtime.net/misc/ray_mungo_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Marshall Bloom&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ray Mungo &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"journalism","slug":"journalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/journalism/"},{"name":"freedom","slug":"freedom","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/freedom/"}]},{"title":"Secret Societies Converge to Get their Freak On:  Arisia 2009 con report","slug":"secret-societies-converge-to-get-their-freak-on-arisia-2009","date":"2009-01-20T01:40:24.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/secret-societies-converge-to-get-their-freak-on-arisia-2009/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/secret-societies-converge-to-get-their-freak-on-arisia-2009/","excerpt":"My first impression of Arisia was one of sartorial richness, stirred together with equal parts of humor, history, literary allusion, and performing arts.

And you could follow some of those threads on the con Twitter feed. Probably the most creative gang were the retrofuturepunk rocket troops, decked out in a combination of jumpsuits, Sky Captain gear, and terrific pressure tank backpacks that sprouted tubes, gauges, and exotically useless stylizations. How cool that I found a livejournal link to their own photoset too! Of the few panel sessions that I was able to attend, the session on Copyright, Theory and Practice was the standout on Friday night, in which the panelists held forth on whether or not copyright law is entirely broken, and what is likely to happen in the future. Most panelists seemed to agree that, like it or not, the ease with which digital copies can be disseminated over the Internet has completely changed the ball game. From Richard Stallman&#8216;s point of view that is an undeniably good thing, since the proliferation of knowledge and easy access to it for all is an engine of self-empowerment and democritization. From Stallman’s point of view, it is not the idea of copyright that is broken, but rather the current idea of intellectual property which is bankrupt. The problem seems to stem from the degree to which rights of ownership can be asserted over the creative arts; whether they be performances on stage and screen, or fruits of the mind such as literary works, inventions, even abstract ideas. Can someone really OWN the idea of a mouse-click? Or own the identity a particular white-gloved Mouse? When it comes to musical recordings, the studios that owned the distribution rights have sold us copies as LPs, then as Cassettes, then as CDs, and now want to sell us the same music as digital files. Despite the fact that us consumers may have only been buying a limited use license, it was much easier to ignore the complications when our rights were tied to physical objects (like used LPs or books) that we could sell at a yard sale or on eBay. But now that digital files can be zapped anywhere, and can be discovered or sent out en masse with technologies like napster or bit-torrent, the act of piracy enters new and strange territory. Indeed the Internet has become the open sea - swarming with the King’s navy, privateers, and scurvy pirates - and whomever gets the goods buries the treasure! Just because it is obvious to us (that is to say the ordinary consumer of information objects) that the jig is up, that the RIAA have hung themselves by their own petard, doesn’t mean that the enforcers of unenforceable patents and copyrights are going to roll over and play dead. Moderator, Alan Wexelblat, pointed out that RIAA makes a living out of creating targets and going after them for their clients; there is no likelihood whatsoever of them giving up their single purpose in life, no matter how ridiculous and evil it seems in light of present circumstances. Regardless of whether we want to grab the latest work of a blockbuster artist, to nibble at the long tail of minor players and unknowns, or even to scour the Inter-waves for long lost orphans that nobody cares about, there has got to be a better way. Panelist Traina seemed to think that fixing the existing copyright statutes was the way to go, while Stallman had a more radical proposal: let people pirate anything at all, but place a tax on media and medium, which funds will be redistributed to all the artists. This idea had an interesting wrinkle: don’t pay out based on percentages of total downloads (which of course would be a total hand-out to “big” name artists), but to calculate distributions as the cube root of downloads! In this way even the mega-names would only get ten times more than the intrepid nobody at the end of the long tail. Brilliant, really! So go buy a gnu. The artistic highlights of Arisia 2009 were definitely the display of hand-welded robots, by Skunkadelia, and the GOH talks by Dave Seeley. Skunk really pulled out all the stops. He set up a gang of the scruffiest, sleekest, shiny-est, grimey-est, half lit, half drunk, junkyard robots you will ever see! Like they just walked out of your grand-dad’s garage and took off in rocket’s blast for Burning Man. These robots are cool! And Dave Seeley gave two long, excellent talks. One was a recap of his career as an artist, and the other was a step-by-step discussion of how he creates his superb images. Probably the most fun linked series of panels was on Designing a Science Fiction Work. This was split into four, hour-long, brainstorms, for building a world, framing a story, creating the characters, and roughing out the visual concept. Both the writer GOH, Walter H. Hunt, and artist GOH, Dave Seeley, participated in most of these sessions, along with writer Peter Prellwitz. The open discussions were sometimes wandering, sometimes witty, and always had to be rounded up within an hour deadline. These are fun! On Saturday, the Making Tropes Interesting panel first surveyed the audience for their favorite SF and Fantasy tropes, then discussed how they themselves evaluated and refashioned such tropes in their own work. Barry Longyear was adamant about not thinking about tropes to begin with, not trying to consciously differentiate his own writing from previous works by over-analyzing their themes. This left the panel in basically two camps: those who totally embraced the idea of premeditated trope-tweaking, and those (Longyear) who said “let the story rip” without so much parsing before hand. Managed to catch three film features during the con: Full Metal Alchemist, Westworld, and Bamboo Saucer. Definitely the Bamboo Saucer showing was my favorite! Not only does the story revolve around two clandestine teams (one American, one Russian) who infiltrate the People’s Republic of China to search for a flying saucer…but the Russian and Chinese characters actually have dialogue in their own languages. I was thrilled! A corny SF movie in three languages, all of which I can understand, what a total riot! Bamboo Saucer is surprisingly well done, considering it’s B-Movie status, but it is full of random hilariousness. In one scene, the US commander confronts the Russian commander after taking away the machine gun that the Russian was using to shoot at everyone. Once he has retrieved his own pistol, the American points it at the Russian and snarls: “I oughtta shoot your treacherous head off!“ Other amusement: when the US fighter pilot is trying to get to know the hot blonde Russian translator, she indignantly tells him that Russian women are not just hausfraus, that her own work is centered on “super heterodyne feedback determinations.“ The pilot says that if she’s just like a man, then maybe she is packing a weapon under her jumpsuit. “Aren’t you going to search me?” she sneers, putting up her hands. As the pilot takes his time frisking her, he says: “Are you sure Russian women are no different from Russian men?” Later on, when the team has managed to enter the saucer, there ensues a hilarious scene with the pilot and translator squashed up against the control panel together, supposedly due to the UFOs internal gravitational field. Their absurd pantomime of reaching for the button together &#8212; it takes both their strength apparently as she holds onto his index finger &#8212; would even have Sigmund Freud giggling in his sleeve. But really the best part of this forgotten film is when they have taken off in the space ship with the only other survivor of a battle with the PLA troops, and fly off at the “speed of light” into space on a crash course with Saturn. Their ensuing struggle to regain control of the ship by punching in all the possible permutations of four numbers is juicy stuff. The last panel I was able to attend was on secret societies, an interesting topic to be sure. The panelists included a freemason (Mark Justin Waks), a member of both Golden Dawn and OTO (Adrianne Brennan), and a vampire fiction publisher (Innana Arthen). Although there were some interesting points made about the nature of secret societies and the individuals that make them up, the conversation always seemed on the edge of something potentially fascinating but never quite getting there. Was it because the best “known” secret societies are the freemasons and the Illuminati? Or because the insularity of secret societies themselves prevent us from seeing how they really operate in the world at large? Arthen’s comments were the most interesting to me, placing the context of her work in progress in the milieu of the American 1950s, when secret societies and political activism were actually more prevalent than we would normally assume, considering the paranoid cold-war and anti-communist fervor of the McCarthyist times. But, I must say I did not much care for the idea of secret societies of vampires, preserving their knowledge for the eternity of undead initiates. Except for some random mentions of Skull and Bones, nobody even cared to mention the elites that rule the world, such as the Bilderbergs, secret governments, disinformation operatives, and energy cartels. To these one might presume to have mentioned the Papadiabolis’ clan in R. A. Lafferty’s Devil is Dead, if we really wanted to get to the meat of the matter; for are there not, walking among us (or at least zipping overhead in private planes), a genuine breed of vampires, sucking out our organs (Bug Jack Barron), beating down our resistance (1984), and breeding us to be proper slaves (Brave New World)? Anyway, who needs “conspiracy” theories when we have the New York Times as a newspaper of public record, a rag populated with drivel concocted by the fools behind Total Information Awareness? &nbsp; &nbsp;","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"},{"name":"costume","slug":"costume","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/costume/"},{"name":"con report","slug":"con-report","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/con-report/"},{"name":"arisia","slug":"arisia","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/arisia/"}]},{"title":"The Groove is Analog","slug":"the-groove-is-analog","date":"2009-01-06T05:04:43.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-groove-is-analog/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-groove-is-analog/","excerpt":"","text":"I was talking with my friend Don about this cool book I am reading about the rocket scientist John Whiteside Parsons &#8212; _Strange Angel_ &#8212; when the conversation somehow changed tracks to Leon Theremin, the enigmatic Soviet inventor.

But how, you might ask, do we get this 100 quadrillion BTU monkey off our back? The answer, as ridiculous as it sounds, is to simply build better homes, and used efficient heat exchange. Really, that’s it! In Germany they are already doing this, building passive heat homes, with highly efficient air flow heat exchangers, and hermetically sealed window and door edges. The technology isn’t new, but it does rely on (a) good engineering, and (b) good construction techniques. The American style of building &#8212; some sheets of Tyvek slapped on plywood and stud frames, thrown together by a couple of guys with nailguns &#8212; is NOT going to cut it! What we do need is intelligent manufacture of super-efficient modular windows and doors, that can be mounted into highly insulated walls. Why not put the laid-off crews of Republic Windows back to work, or even re-tool the auto-industry to build super-efficient home construction components, instead of gas-guzzling dinosaurs? That’s what I proposed to Obama on his transition web blog… not that the idea will ever get to him, but there’s no harm in trying! For decades (yes, sadly decades) I have been advocating for a heat-exchanger attachement for refridgerators in American homes. Doesn’t it strike you as INSANE that we pay to heat up the space inside our homes, then we pay AGAIN to chill down another space inside of our homes to store our food? That has always been an insane idea to me! Therefore, for anyone who lives in a climate where the temperature outside the home falls below the temperature inside the home, why not put a heat exchanger between the outside and the air pocket surrounding the fridge interior? A temperature gauge can control when the vents open on the heat exchanger. Therefore, when the outside temp drops to a cold enough level, the vent opens and automatically pre-cools the air pocket that exists between the fridge interior and its shell, thus saving energy when the freon compressor kicks in. Duh! Why not let the cold outside air cool off our fridge compartment, instead of heating it first then paying to cool it down again? But then, that would be giving logic and energy-efficiency primacy over greed… and we can’t allow THAT to happen, can we? Or can we! Yes, we can! So join me in pushing all of our alternative construction, transportation, &amp; energy ideas to business, industry, finance, government, mom, pop, and Auntie Grizelda.

Though, don’t get me wrong, I admire the artistry of the goofy BEM pulp painting, it’s just not the image I would pick to represent my visualization of the alien encounter! That being said, the artist might be forgiven for falling into the reactive stereotype caused by the relentless alien advance seen on decades of War of the Worlds jackets. Indeed, a perusal of the various covers for War of the Worlds __&#8212; continuously in print since 1898 &#8212; makes for fascinating study all by itself. Of course we find no shortage of tentacled tripods and slick spaceships laying waste to planet Earth. However there are some images which appear to be almost comical, considering the subject matter involves wiping out half of the human race. Strangely enough, very few of the covers deal with any sort of physical contact between humans and aliens, although that turns out to be the pivotal element of the plot, of course… Only the Heinemann cover, with its kitsch skeletal claw and a background sky that is washed out into vague foreboding, begins to touch on the appropriate level of psychological horror. While the recent Spanish edition, with its octopus tentacle coiling beneath the paranoid single eyeball, and a landscape full of burn-out trees under a pink sky finally delivers on the promise of aliens out to get us! One must sit back to wonder about whether or not aliens even care enough to pay us a visit, whether they are really concerned about our piffling nuclear bombs and other instruments of self-destruction, or if &#8212; in fact &#8212; they have already completely infiltrated our societies and governments, and are deliberately pushing us to the brink. When you take into account the hyperactive mayhem and financial ruin that has resulted from the years of Bush and Cheney, you really must begin to wonder what the hell is in that “man sized safe“ at the Naval Observatory! Personally, I wish those bastards would come out of the safe and have at us &#8212; anything is better than dealing with their geopolitical vampire go-between.

The most shocking aspect of the exhibit, which of course is deliberately unstated, is the feeling of creeping familiarity that we have when looking at the works &#8212; don’t we also live in the same space? What makes the brutality and insanity of a regime that espouses torture any different from the KGB under Stalin, after all? As the attendees munched cheese and sipped Hungarian red wine, did they not feel a twinge of empathy for the character of Sergei Kotov in the brilliant (and terrifying) film, Burnt by the Sun? Or was that just me? Still, it is always instructive to try to feel and understand what the artists were envisioning, and to appreciate the subtle (or unsubtle) ironies of how they depicted life under tyranny. Yuri Rybchinsky’s photos of prisons and slavering guard dogs are taken as if they were totally impersonal snapshots from a Kodak Brownie, and yet are riveting for their subject matter and splendid foreshortening which electrify the images with sudden energy. The untitled portrait (perhaps self-portrait) by the art student, Boris Sveshnikov, while living in exile at the gulag is executed with almost casual mastery. But the expression of the subject is riven with the poignance of a man beaten but never defeated. Back in the realm of obviousness, the large canvas by Alexei Sundakov that appeared over the opening descriptive summary of the exhibit, showed a crowd of people with their backs turned to the viewer, all hovering toward an invisible object that may have existed &#8212; though probably did not &#8212; under a sign reading meat. Is this enough to convey the sense of malaise and dissatisfaction that it proposes? Only through the flawless sterility of the scene, painted with smooth mastery reminiscent of George Tooker. The exhibit featured a number of excellent pieces, including those of Peeter Ulas, Vello Vin, Ernst Neisvestny, and Oskar Rabin, to name a few. The substance of the commentaries seemed to be derived partly from the book, Beyond Memory: Soviet Nonconformist Photography, which looks quite good, especially the section on Subversive Photography by Ernest Larsen. The show-stealing image, which appeared on the cover of the program, and which was reproduced on a gigantic 4 meter wide banner hanging from the atrium wall, was Boris Mikhailov’s hand-tinted photo of some Soviet apparatchiks marching along, draped with their honorary sashes. These are ordinary politicos in a local affair, which is evident by the disorganized band of smiling young pioneers marching behind them. Etched into these faces are the agonizing realities of being tools in the state machine, the machine that fattens them with luxuries while others go hungry, the machine that hustles them to and from meetings while others stand wearily in lines for non-existent meat. The farcical splash of super-rich primary colors across the black and white print, gives an obscene, Walt Disney edge to the parody! How this image provokes us to think of our own times, when party-line weasels enacted policies promulgated by the likes of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the unseen octopus of geo-politicial black artists who stood them up before us! What sarcasm and gallows humor have we all had with their evil ways, all gaudily pumped up on their own false-flagged patriotism…don’t these bastards all look alike?","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/politics/"},{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/review/"}]},{"title":"Whats in the Air Over Saturn?","slug":"whats-in-the-air-over-saturn-and-earth","date":"2008-11-19T00:34:53.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T01:18:32.000Z","comments":true,"path":"COSMOS/whats-in-the-air-over-saturn-and-earth/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/COSMOS/whats-in-the-air-over-saturn-and-earth/","excerpt":"","text":"Interesting images captured by Cassini show us the sky over Saturn’s north pole, spanned by a hexagon of clouds in fixed rotation with the gas giant.

And why must humans always infer the hand of a higher being in the cosmic beauty all around us? Isn’t it enough to simply accept reality as a mind-bending matrix of symmetry, of consciousness, of amazement? What do we gain from dogmatic demands on our perceptions, after all. Not much. Unbidden neuroses and unnecessary fears. What those self-righteous idiots &#8212; the self-proclaimed believers &#8212; have done to our planet Earth is an atrocity. Because they are the chosen people and because they will live forever in their bogus Eternity, they see no problem in laying our entire reality to waste.

His radio spot lasted 45 years, the entire second half of the 20th Century. His books gave voice to the voiceless, and he wrote the history of the lives that get lost between the lines of the rich and famous…the history of real people who work and struggle to makes ends meet. Terkel was as much a product of Chicago as Nelson Algren, and yet his works span the continent, embracing the breadth and width of the American Experience. I actually had no idea who Terkel was until one day that I met him by accident at La Guardia Airport in New York City in the Winter of 1979. I was waiting for a flight to Albuquerque on a cold dark evening in December, typing up some notes on my old glass-keyed Royal portable typewriter. Studs came walking along the terminal and asked where I was going. I explained that I was going to visit my father during the winter break from college. After a few more words of idle chit-chat, Studs put down his bulging, beat up leather briefcase and asked me to watch it for him while he went to get a cup of hot tea. I said sure thing and after about fifteen minutes he came wandering back, blowing his nose in a handkerchief and breathing steam rising from a styrofoam cup. “Thanks a lot, kid,” Terkel said. “Terrible cold I got this trip.” I asked him where he was going back to, and he said Chicago. I told him I was from Chicago too, after which he introduced himself and we had a rambling conversation. When he got up to go to his gate, he said, “By the way, this bag you were watching has the manuscript of the new book I’m working on.” Then he thanked me again and went on his way. I sat back and thought, what an amazing man! He trusts his current book with a total stranger! And remember, this was back in 1979, when manuscripts were reams of paper, painstakingly typed, whited out, blue-penciled and stet-marked. But there it is… Later on, I found out that the book he left with me was the draft copy of American Dreams: Lost and Found. And that’s how I got introduced to both the man and his work. Studs Terkel knew what it means to struggle and dream, and he trusted his fellow men and women to be able to comprehend their situation, to describe it in their own words, and to transcend their problems. Studs Terkel knew the meaning of trust, which is why we could always trust him to tell the truth.","categories":[{"name":"HUMAN BEINGS","slug":"HUMAN-BEINGS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/HUMAN-BEINGS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"writers","slug":"writers","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/writers/"},{"name":"journalism","slug":"journalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/journalism/"},{"name":"society","slug":"society","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/society/"}]},{"title":"Halloween Demon With a Sweet Tooth","slug":"halloween-demon-with-a-sweet-tooth","date":"2008-11-02T00:43:15.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:13:47.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/halloween-demon-with-a-sweet-tooth/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/halloween-demon-with-a-sweet-tooth/","excerpt":"","text":"Our first halloween in the new apartment passed quietly, with our household demon getting into the spirit of things by gritting a mini-Butterfinger bar in his pointy teeth.

Yes, at this fine emporium you can feed your prurient curiosity by purchasing framed portraits of the Borden family. Not your ordinary portraits, but ones that change from actual photographs to ghoulish skulls depending on the angle from which they are seen. Charming.

These people who were (often) truly not worthy of the education they received (or supposedly received) rose to the top of companies such as AIG, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government.

I even went so far as to buy a boat, which at the time was a half-sunken wreck full of bilgewater, then I hauled it up onto a drydock at Seal Beach, California and proceded to slave away on the encrusted hull. It took me weeks to shave off the giant beard of seaweed, barnacles, and dreck that had accumulated. Eventually, with the help of a curious shipwright from Belize, Wally Flowers, I re-caulked the seams of those hardwood planks, pitched and varnished the hull, and painted it with shiny lead-saturated marine white. What a beauty that boat was, the Lady L! But that’s a different story… The point is that I always dreamed of sailing away across the ocean and making it to China. A mad dream perhaps. A sordid capitulation from my dream of being a Tea Baron, you might say. But nonetheless, a vision of the great sea, of towering slow rolling waves, of flying fish hitting the deck, and of being gazed upon by the weird eye of a Leviathan as it floated up from the deeps. Thor Heyerdal put one hell of a monkey on my back, it’s true! And today, it turns out, that similar mad fools have been dreaming of their own slow boat journey from China!

Linebarger, of course, is the SF writer we all know and love as the amazing Cordwainer Smith. **Update! The full article is now available on Harper’s: Part 1, Part 2** Was Linebarger actually the model for Kirk Allen? That exceptionally interesting question has been delved into by Alan C. Elms in his essay: Behind the Jet-Propelled Couch, where Elms discusses attribution of Linebarger’s identity. Supposedly the secret was revealed by Dr. Lindner to Leon Stover at a cocktail party hosted by Harvard’s Fairbank Center in 1951 or 1952, and Stover later leaked the information to Brian Aldiss. Since Aldiss published this claim in his classic Billion Year Spree (1973), it has been a subject of feverish speculation throughout fandom. Or so I would imagine. Linebarger’s daughter, Rosana, has also discussed the Kirk Allen identity question on the excellent Cordwainer Smith website that she maintains. I am such an admirer of C’Mell and the Underpeople, that I plan to examine the Jet-Propelled Couch chapter in great detail.

Of course we all have our moments of connection with the cosmic wonder of the skies, but Borden’s single-minded mission to promote the healing powers of the changing cloud-scapes strikes me as all the more essential in a world where the attention of human beings is constantly diverted, attenuated, and channelized in deliberate and pernicious ways. Not counting the hours spent at work, the majority of people in the so-called “developed” world spend a great deal of their own time driving automobiles and watching television. The task of driving, naturally, requires full attention (though this apparently is not very well-practiced judging by the careening, cell-phone babbling, hair-styling, food-gobbling, child-slapping, dog-scolding, and otherwise carelessly crashing idiots that I see behind the wheel every day!) And inside of all these vehicles there is scant occasion to gaze at the sky. Perhaps a mere glimpse of some mind-bendingly beautiful sunset of saffron rays and rose tinted clouds is caught in between a giant plastic food-chain sign and a screen of traffic signal armatures…that is all most people have of the sky from their vehicles. And as for television, let us just say that the maddeningly jump-cut radiations of images, together with hammering snippets of music amid violent cacophanies, is not going to lower the brain-dead zombie demographic any time soon. But the sky! The show of shows! An endless shifting marvel of light, color and drifting cotton is piled up to the heavens, and we have only to step outside and tilt our necks to have it all for free. This, indeed, is the cure for the Internet! It’s always there for us, nobody owns it, it exists in eternal unfettered freedom, and thus draws us all into dreams and cerebrations. In the Tarot deck the clouds are used to depict the element of Air, as seen in the suit of Swords. From the serenity of the Queen of Swords, to the agitated fury of the Princess, the clouds reflect our state of mind. What is it about the clouds that inspires us to ponder? Their slowly twisting majesty, their mysterious shapes that constantly elide one another then disappear into the vaporous twirls of a dragon’s mustache. Is that it? Or is it some deeper connection with our souls, a reminder of the nebulous and undefinable nature of our existence? Yes, perhaps those clouds remind us that we, too, are nothing more than ephemeral shapes gliding through the imagined landscapes of our own thoughts. And like stormy skies, when our thoughts are embroiled in dark writhings, thunder and lightning arrives with supernatural fire. ZAP! There is a thunderbolt for your consciousness. You are free from those imaginary constraints. In the pouring rain, you dash forward to reach the other shore. Your mind is clear. The clouds break. Shimmering light begins to glow within the banks of white clouds. Everything becomes astonishingly obvious and sparks seem to fly from your eyes… You whirl around in the amazement of realization…and you are left standing face-to-face with the simple (and at the same time, ultimate) reality. So life begins!

How can it be that most people know Dangle only because of his Airborne packages, and not for his amazing comics? Dangle has a biting dry wit, and what you would think is a cynical view of the United States…and yet, if go back through his work, you can feel the continuous strain of a fuming anger, which boils up into occasional insensate rage at all the things wrong with this country. Indeed, like many of us, Dangle is a regular patriot, a true-believer in what America should have been, and a raging don’t-tread-on-me advocate for some kind of justice that will bring down the scumbags who have esconced themselves in seats of power. Otherwise, why would he bother to ramp himself up into such delirious furies in the pages of Troubletown? How on earth could he sustain it for twenty years? All these people crying for the loss of gonzo journalism ought to browse back through the archive of Troubletown. They should take a look at some of the classic strips, which manage to go directly for the jugular of the worst criminal swine in recent history - laying out the ugliness of their actions in broad daylight - and at the same time making us laugh our heads off with joy at the mere thought that the criminal perversity of American politics can somehow be shaken down and fixed. Not that Dangle comes off as any kind of saint! Aficionados of his short-lived Dangle Comics, published by Drawn and Quarterly, will remember some fantastic frenzies of debauchery, self-loathing, and wanton mayhem. Not to mention one of the funniest strips about bike messengers in the history of comics! The sneering, uber-critical Dangle tone is laid on thick in these minor masterpieces, a prime example of which would be the “Reviewer’s Night Out” that appeared in Dangle #2. I’ve scanned the closing segment of this two-page feature, which you can see by clicking on the following panel. How on earth did the Dangle brain develop? A revealing insight is found in Scott Butki’s Interview with Dangle that appeared in BlogCritics Magazine (July 2007): “Odd as it sounds, I had a crazy image of myself being a cartoonist when I was a kid. I imagined I would have this really cool lifestyle where I sit around a groovy Manhattan apartment, smoking a pipe, being witty and urbane, and somehow wads of money would just flow in. After a lot of missteps and twists and turns I ended up doing almost exactly what I had pictured, except for the pipe and the Manhattan digs&ndash;&ndash;and the money. Mostly, I have always been very good at ridiculing people and drawing portraits that exaggerate their flaws and sensitivities. These things in the normal world will get you fired or beaten up, but for a cartoonist they come in very handy.” So here’s to you, Dangle! Twenty more years!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"comics","slug":"comics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/comics/"},{"name":"journalism","slug":"journalism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/journalism/"},{"name":"politics","slug":"politics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/politics/"},{"name":"artists","slug":"artists","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/artists/"}]},{"title":"That Evil Genius","slug":"that-evil-genius","date":"2008-07-31T01:11:12.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/that-evil-genius/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/that-evil-genius/","excerpt":"","text":"Now where have I heard a similar story before?

Since many of them are still alive, Moorcock wanted to avoid conflicts. Despite the pleas of his editor… who said “look, you just write the book, and let our lawyers sort out the rest” …Moorcock still felt badly about a tiff he’d gotten into with J. G. Ballard over the origins of the book Crash. Out of curiosity I went to the bookshelf and pulled down the copy of New Worlds Quarterly #2 to see what was in it, and lo and behold! the Ballard contribution is an essay on Wyndham Lewis&#8216; classic trilogy, The Human Age. It’s too bad that this essay (Visions of Hell) is so long out of print, but in the interest of protecting Ballard’s copyright, I won’t reproduce it here. Suffice it to say, that the commonly used quote from the article, which appeared in Maria Faustino’s Heaven and Hell (2004), is not by any means the best, though conveniently for some readers, it does occupy the opening paragraph! Hell is out of fashion &#8212; institutional hells at any rate. The populated infernos of the twentieth century are more private affairs, the gaps between the bars are the sutures of one’s own skull… A valid hell is one from which there is a possibility of redemption, even if it is never achieved, the dungeons of an architecture of grace whose spires point to some kind of heaven. The institutional hells of the present century are reached with one-way tickets, marked Nagasaki and Buchenwald, worlds of terminal horror even more final than the grave. _ _ Interesting, of course, but it only sets the stage for Ballard’s discussion of Lewis, which is quite juicy. As a casual aside, Ballard mentions a radio performance of The Human Age, in which Donald Wolfit performed as the Bailiff: Put on by the Third Programme ten years ago with tremendous style and panache, and with a virtuoso performance by Donald Wolfit as the Bailiff, the trilogy came over superbly as black theological cabaret. Written in 1955, this puts the radio play in 1956, the year before Wolfit was knighted for his service to the theatre! Apparently the performance of surrealistic black comedy based on the works of a madman like Lewis is no drawback when it comes to being vetted for Knighthood, which is a great relief really, when you think about it. The radio program was produced by D. G. Bridson, and strangely enough, Harvard seems to have a copy of the original radio script… which warrants further inquiry on my part! Getting back to Ballard’s essay, Visions of Hell, personally I found the most fascinating aspect of the piece to be Ballard’s appraisal of Lewis: Although his criticism is written with a tremendous elan, a boiling irritability and impatience with fools, Lewis’s reputation began to slide, particularly as his right-wing views seemed to reveal a more than sneaking sympathy for Hitler and the Nazis… The inner eye of the blind painter, warped by his own bile and malign humour, illuminates a landscape beyond time, space, and death. Already cut off by temperament from the mood of his age, he inhabits a private purgatory or, rather, sits with the other journeymen to the grave on the nominal ground outside the walls of limbo, waiting to begin his descent into hell. Hmm, sounds a lot like Vermilion Sands to me! But, of course, those were the stories that Ballard was writing at the time he published this piece in New Worlds, so the imagery may be a projection of his own onto The Human Age. Nonetheless, being one of the half-dozen humans in North America who has actually read the trilogy, I can tell you that Ballard’s description of the bizarre circumstances of the work is spot on, and I detect more than a casual link between the ineffectual and morally tranquilized character, Pullman, in Lewis’s trilogy, and the oddly distant protagonists of Ballard’s works. What Ballard managed to do &#8212; and one of the reasons I love his writing so much &#8212; is to transmute the leaden trappings of Christian theology and Miltonian brimstone into the alienated gold of the modern built environment. If anything, Ballard’s world in High Rise is colder, more aloof, and twice as sinister as the Hell depicted in The Human Age. There is a disturbing sense of displacement in Ballard’s hell, because we are not so much removed from the world of the living, but merely trapped in it, and forced to examine it with unrelenting consciousness of the flaws that we have built in to everything around us… We drift helplessly onto a concrete island and lay trapped there, immobilised by the terror of realization &#8212; this is the world we have made, and there is no escape!","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"writers","slug":"writers","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/writers/"},{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"},{"name":"society","slug":"society","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/society/"}]},{"title":"Planetary geology and memories of Marty Prinz","slug":"planetary-geology-and-memories-of-marty-prinz","date":"2008-07-08T19:51:43.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:51:34.000Z","comments":true,"path":"HUMAN-BEINGS/planetary-geology-and-memories-of-marty-prinz/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/HUMAN-BEINGS/planetary-geology-and-memories-of-marty-prinz/","excerpt":"","text":"With Phoenix Lander scooping ice cubes and sand castles from the polar beach of Mars, it seems that planetary geology is becoming popular. Images from the Messenger fly-by of six months ago are now being recycled through the news media, showing vulcanism on the surface of Mercury. Even the New York Times gets into the act, featuring articles on Moon rocks and lunar soil chemisty. However, these are just the latest pages in a long story, and can’t really compare to the excitement of the planetary geology craze that erupted during the time of the Apollo missions. Back in those days of the late 60s and early 70s, the first samples were carried back from the Moon, and whisked under armed guard to the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico. Luckily for me, my father became friends with the Institute’s Senior Research Scientist, Marty Prinz, who was one of the leading geologists working on Moon rocks when they first arrived to planet Earth. In recent years, I was sure that a Wikipedia page or other resource would provide a biography of Marty. After all, how many geologists have an asteroid named after them? But strangely enough there is hardly a mention of him outside of the literature on spinels, llmenites, and electron microprobe analyses of Apollo lunar samples. So let me tell you a little bit about the wonderful Prinz family… Marty was actually one of the most wordly and widely read people you can imagine. His bookshelf was no more dominated by books on geology and science, than any other kind of literature, ranging from the classical to the modern, from the serious and abstruse to the purely absurd. Vicky Prinz, Marty’s wife at the time, was equally gregarious. They were among the few people who could keep my father spinning and diving for cover during a dinner conversation. Of course, being the tender age of 12 or 13 years old at the time, I was mostly interested in playing with the Prinz’ children: Martha, Will and Michael. Say, if any of you three run across this article, drop me an email! We should put together a proper Wikipedia page. But here is something you will not find out anywhere else: when I left New Mexico to go to college, I got a one-way ticket from Albuquerque to New York City. By that time, Marty Prinz had taken the job as curator of the Mineral collection of the American Museum of Natural History. Since he was probably the only person my family knew in Manhattan, he was asked to pick me up at the airport and escort me over to Columbia College. Well, Marty showed up in his Volkswagen van and swept me over the Triborough Bridge. In practically no time we were heading West along East 97th Street towards the Transverse Road that cuts through Central Park. While we were waiting for a stop light, being the first car behind the crosswalk, I was amazed to discover that the host of Masterpiece Theatre, no less than Alaister Cooke himself, was walking right in front of our car! “Marty, that’s Alastair Cooke, isn’t it?” “Yeah, so it appears,” said Marty and then proceeded to honk his horn and wave his arm in a menacing circle out of the driver’s window. Cooke scampered across the street with a terrified look in his eyes. The light had turned green while Cooke was in the crosswalk, and Marty stepped on the gas barely before the 70 year old had cleared our front bumper. Suddenly, the reality of being in New York City dawned on me in that little encounter…you might be a celebrity, you might be the bloody host of Masterpiece Theatre, but when you come to the big city, get the hell outta the way when the light turns green, okay buddy! Needless to say, when Marty subsequently dumped me without ceremony on the corner of Broadway and 114th Street and then drove off immediately I had my own breathless taste of coping in a hurry. After that, Marty &amp; I met occasionally for a chat over some Chinese food at Hunan Garden, or at the Museum where he showed me - with very uncharacteristic amount of trust, I always thought - the elaborate alarm system that he had installed to protect the amazing minerals collection, which included nothing less than the shimmering Star of India Sapphire. Marty Prinz was always witty, sometimes irascible, and fond of bitingly humorous ripostes. Although he passed away in 2000, Marty’s Guide to Rocks and Minerals (edited with George Harlow and Joseph Peters) is still in print and considered the standard book on the subject. So as we turn once again to the craze in Moon rocks and harvesting the dust of nearby planets, let’s raise a toast to one of the pioneers in that field… ad astra, Marty!","categories":[{"name":"HUMAN BEINGS","slug":"HUMAN-BEINGS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/HUMAN-BEINGS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"orbit","slug":"orbit","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/orbit/"}]},{"title":"The New Masters Arrive On Thunder and Lightning!","slug":"the-new-masters-arrive-on-thunder-and-lightning","date":"2008-07-01T21:37:22.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/the-new-masters-arrive-on-thunder-and-lightning/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/the-new-masters-arrive-on-thunder-and-lightning/","excerpt":"","text":"Of course, I was intrigued by the advertisement in this year’s Boskone mag for the Illustration Master Class.

Except, of course, that I still sort of get the feeling every now and then. And what a creeping gooseflesh of terror that is! So I really have to thank Graham Charnock, one of the most entertaining jokers of British fandom, for his recent piece called “Harringay Lit,” which appeared in CHUNGA #14. As Graham puts it: “I’d been visited by a group of characters I thought I’d invented, and after talking to them I had decided to tear up my manuscript because it was obviously so unbelievable.” If only he knew how true that was for me as well! How clearly I can recall that morning back in 1986 in Woodstock, New York, when the phone call came through from that agent, whatever her name was, who wanted to see my manuscript. Sipping my black coffee, I contemplated the scenario of submitting that 400 page colossus, when suddenly all of the overwrought characters from the book, with all their faults and fetishes along with their preposterous ticks and dialects came to life in my brain. I felt as if I was choking and drowning in the banality of that rotten prose, in the senseless brawling and the random lyrical pastiches (painted on too thick, with a floor mop instead of a sable brush), and that whole pile of verbiage began barking and howling at me like a wretched dog under the full moon… I am telling you that during that moment of truth, when I solemnly picked up the stack of paper and dumped it directly into the rubbish bin, I freed all those bats out of my belfry forever! Devil take them, the bastards, for wasting two years of my youth! No, if ever my fingers begin to itch over a keyboard and strain to deliver another long manuscript of maudlin rantings, believe me, it will be a completely different cast of characters… no doubt all of them equally mad, but nonetheless new and never to be found in my current file cabinet of themes and topics. Once you’ve gotten over your writers block &#8212; and past those blasted bongoes &#8212; you know that the only possible redeeming value in your effort is to strike new ground. Yea, the human race goes on to choke on its own shit, but somewhere in the lunatic gleam in the eyes of a writer is an unspoiled landscape, and a new world to fashion from nothingness.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"criticism","slug":"criticism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/criticism/"}]},{"title":"Remembrance of Teas Past","slug":"remembrance-of-teas-past","date":"2008-06-28T17:21:50.000Z","updated":"2017-10-20T19:49:47.000Z","comments":true,"path":"TRAVELS/remembrance-of-teas-past/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/TRAVELS/remembrance-of-teas-past/","excerpt":"It can now be revealed: in 1993 I returned to Yunnan in order to realize my childhood dream of becoming a tea baron.

Disguised in wooden clogs, straw hat, and a wig with a long black queue hanging down his back, Fortune managed to punt along the waterways in the lowliest of riverboats. He dined on what he described as a miserable gruel, called congee, and reconnoitered the tea plantations and temple gardens along his route.

The manager of the Yunnan Tea Branch gave me a wonderful descriptive flyer, reproduced here, for your edification: He also kindly revealed the secret of finding the best quality Yunnan pu-erh, to look for the lucky symbol on the tea package! With this knowledge, I was able to sip the most incredible pu-erh every day for more than 15 years, at the cost of only 50 cents per box of 20 teabags! Alas, all good things come to an end, and in the last year the Lucky brand has vanished from the shelves of every Chinese grocery store that I have seen. From Boston to Portland, from Chicago to San Francisco, Lucky brand is no more! All I can do is to reproduce for you scans of the last package I had, sadly beat up, and only a fond memory of the fine leaves it carried… Well, it’s not a total loss… even though the other brands of pu-erh typically found in Chinese groceries are awful, old leaves from yesteryear, still it is fairly easy to buy decent pu-erh from TenRen Tea Shops. Of course, now you have to pay $3 for 16 tea bags (or $50 an ounce for the good leaves), but if you are a pu-erh addict it’s well worth it. On a similar note, I wanted to share a fond memory of one other tea that recently came my way, the Sikkim Temi Tea. I was given a box of these wondrous leaves by my brother Sangpo’s father, Phuntsok Dorje, who travelled to his hometown of Gontok and brought back a a 1/4 kilo. Sikkim tea is a delightful, crisp brew, like Assam tea with a clear freshness of the high Himalayas. Of course, having gone straight through this for my morning cuppa, it turns out to be nearly impossible to find outside of Sikkim itself, alas! But another fine remembrance of teas past… Perhaps it goes without saying, but I should also mention that I discovered the delights of congee, more popularly known as zhou or xi fan, when I first visited Hong Kong in 1990. How can such a delicious and digestible dish &#8212; such as fish slices in congee &#8212; be considered even remotely related to the starchy and fetid abomination called gruel which Dickens served up to his starving orphans?

What is a thinking man or woman to do? The only thing I can suggest is to ratchet down your own energy footprint, ride a bike, eat locally grown foods, and focus on two key tactics: creating pesticide free &amp; bee friendly habitats, and implementing appropriate technology. If the human race does nothing but blindly spin its wheels, we will very be soon left with no option but to become scavengers when the unsustainable mess comes tumbling down. Koyanisqaatsi, my friends. These thoughts occurred to me when I saw an article on rocket stoves. These make a great deal of sense, because they can burn the smallest scraps of fuel and turn them into cooking energy with the lowest exchange of gases and smoke. The use of appropriate technology clearly should not be limited to people who must be resourceful to avoid starvation, and clearly cannot wait for the approval of idiots who continually drive their ridiculous gas-guzzling monsters to WalMart for 20 pound slabs of read meat.

Since my buddy, Don, who lives in Beverly doesn’t have cable t.v. or internet, I called him up on my cellphone and turned up the volume so he could listen along to the first powered landing on Mars since Viking, 32 years ago. As we were all listening to the transmissions from Mission Control at JPL in California, the whole communications scenario appeared in my mind. What a far out world we live in! As a space vehicle hurtles into the atmosphere of Mars, heat shields flaring up to plasma, it is sending a live signal to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter at 32 KB / second. This signal is then piped back to JPL on earth, taking 15 minutes to traverse the 173,000,000 miles of space that currently separates the two planets. At JPL, the communications of the Mission Control crew, along with video of them sitting in their closed booth, is sent out as a live t.v. broadcast, which is, in turn, converted into a live video stream over the internet. So, here in Salem, Mass, I logged on and while watching this all happen live, decide to ring up Don, across the way in Beverly. Therefore, Don, with nothing more than his cellphone, can listen to the live landing sequence on Mars, as he potters around his back deck lighting up some charcoal on the grill.

Yes, it seems that after a struggle among themselves almost as ridiculous as the opening scene of Trip to the Moon, the astronomers of the world have accepted the fact that dwarf planets are still planets. This means that not only do we regain our recently demoted Pluto, but we bring Ceres and Eris into the tribe. Following this remarkable turn-around in nomenclature, 11-year old Maryn Smith of Great Falls, Montana, won the schoolkids’ contest to invent a nifty mnemonic to help us remember the names of the planets, and their sequence in distance from the sun. Okay, sure, Pluto occasionally loops closer to the sun than Neptune, but after a couple of drinks &#8216;Nine Palace Elephants’ and &#8216;Palace Nine Elephants’ could hardly make a difference, right?","categories":[{"name":"COSMOS","slug":"COSMOS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/COSMOS/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Zombies Devour the Lawless Elite: Boskone 2008","slug":"zombies-devour-the-lawless-elite-boskone-2008","date":"2008-02-18T05:19:35.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/zombies-devour-the-lawless-elite-boskone-2008/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/zombies-devour-the-lawless-elite-boskone-2008/","excerpt":"This year at Boskone, there were some interesting panels, great painting demos by Bob Eggleton and Omar Rayyan, and a nice gallery of paintings from Boskones past and present alongside works by the Artist GOH, Dean Morrissey.

Howard Waldrop was one of Oliver’s oldest and closest friends. When asked about how Oliver became interested in science fiction, Waldrop said that during a childhood bout with rhuematic fever, Oliver was given a stack of pulp magazines to read - his favorites at the time included air war stories and westerns. But by pure accident someone had bought him a copy of Amazing Stories, and having read it, Oliver shot out of his sick bed and rode his bicycle for several miles to the nearest news stand, where he proceeded to buy every science fiction mag he could get his hands on. From that moment Oliver was hooked. Later on, Oliver and Waldrop became fishing buddies and they subsequently spent more than 20 summer fishing trips together in Colorado and other Western spots. Waldrop went on to describe the highlights of Oliver’s writing career, including his novels and best short stories, such as Ghost Ship, (which appeared in Mid-Sep 1983 Analog). After the panel I scoured the Boskone dealers room where I found three of Chad Oliver’s novels, one anthology, and the original issue of Analog with “Ghost Ship!” Thanks to Howard and MITSFS! Mind If We Pick Your Brraains? The Zombie Panel The liveliest panel on Friday night, naturally, was about the brain-eating undead. The moderator, John Langan, (author, critic, and frequent contributor to the Zombie Fiction Database) had his hands full keeping some sort of order among the rabid panelists and raving audience. Seanan McGuire, filker and zombologist, rattled out a veritable dictionary of virology and zombie facts, and said with an almost manic glee that an Ebola outbreak occurred on her birthday. “Anyone who buys me a beer will hear an entire weekend of details,” she offered…though I must say I didn’t subsequently see her in the bar with any takers. Bob Eggleton provided so many juicy details from Zombie films - including the film featured on his t-shirt, Planet Terror - that I seriously began to wonder how he has any time to paint at all! Sonya Taafe shared her virtuoso knowledge of the dissolution of the vampire mythos, from a once glorious state of pure blood-sucking evil, to the overly eroticized dandies that we find today. For example, she pointed out that the original Nosferatu came sailing in on a sea of plague-ridden rats, and was a truly menacing, undead, neckbiting fiend. Michael Swanwick suggested that “it is precisely because the vampires, the Draculas and all the Transylvanian elite became so elegant and refined, that zombies have come shambling into that space which has a need for mindless flesh-eating monsters”. The audience responded with gusto to these remarks, peppering the panel with graphic imagery from their favorite zombie films, comics, and novels, to the point that John Langan fought back desperately to regain some sense of humanity and morality. “In Shaun of the Dead,” he reminded us,”when the protagonist realizes that he has to kill his own mother in order to prevent her from turning into a zombie, isn’t that a kind of gut-wrenching scene? To kill your own mother - put a bullet right between her eyes - we really don’t want to go there!” To which Sonya Taafe replied, “you won’t get more profound boundary-fucking than something that makes you shoot your own mother.” The discussion then turned to what the boundaries were between the meaning of zombies and human survival vis a vis pandemic disease outbreaks, which then proceeded to a sort of taxonomic analysis of the types of zombies - the slow shambling flesh eating type, the shambling brain eating type, the slow but not completely unhuman zombie, and then the “infected” zombies who are not undead, but soon will be, who are very fast on their feet indeed! The idea of an unstoppable pandemic, which nearly all the panelists agreed is almost sure to happen, meant that the zombie has become the perfect metaphor for today’s alienated and bio-paranoid zeitgeist. In short, zombies are just a wake-up call to let you know that any time now, probably tonight, some kind of plague or brain-eating monster is going to be knocking on your door. The good news is that if you live in Viriconium, then you won’t be surprised! The Appeal of the Lawless Elite Fortunately when the zombies come a’knockin we will have bands of lawless elites raising banners of insurrection and sweeping away our current rotten, self-destructive society to replace it with something better. Or not. Surely the liveliest panel on Saturday, the discussants of this session came out in a blaze of rhetorical gunfire. Alexander Jablokov defined the need for the lawless elite in this way: “when you are sitting through some insufferable harangue at your local town committee meeting, and the stark flourescent lighting on school cafeteria tables reveals what a petty and impossible situation it is to actually solve anything in politics, don’t you just want to pick up a sword and cut all those idiots’ heads off?” Hearty agreement all around set in motion the discussion that followed. Yes, there will always be a grievance and there will always be some segment of the population who wants to take the situation into their own hands. But is literature about the lawless elite just a form of escapism to let off steam? Or does it have actual ramifications in how we deal with our political situation? Then the Turner Diaries was brought up as an example of how a work of fiction about a lawless elite can be used as real propaganda to stir up action. Karl Schroeder insisted that evil arises from a sense of being victimized. There was some debate among the panelists and audience on that topic, but Schroeder refused to budge on his opinion, though he eventually hedged it to mean that a certain kind of evil is caused by a group feeling victimized, but not ALL evil per se. Looking more closely at the “elite” part of lawless elites, historical examples of revolutions that occurred in the name of the masses but which were manipulated by small groups into totalitarian regimes were examined. “Weren’t the American revolutionary leaders a lawless elite?” someone asked. Indeed! Meacham concurred, they were a small group of rich, white, male, slave-owners. “But didn’t they specifically reject Aristocracy and kingship, in favor of democracy? They created a sunset provision for themselves in order to relinquish control of the state to an elected body of government.” Paul Park suggested that perhaps personal power at the local level - being a big fish in a small pond - is actually more satisfying than being a King over a messy state. So why shouldn’t Washington refuse the crown and return to Mt. Vernon, where he had a visceral sense of total power? Hmm, food for thought! Another audience member asked for comments on lawless elites that exist WITHIN the state that they are supposedly defending - the rogue cops, the Dirty Harries, the entire Bush-Cheney junta… This led to speculations on fictional scenarios in which rogue elements within the government were engaged in wiping out other rogue elements that had crossed the invisible line in their own actions. Although these lawless elites believed themselves to be defending the state, at some point they become nothing more than thugs and terrorists. Believable? Too close to reality? A premise that might sell! And then what of the lawless elite once their job is done? Do they sunset themselves out of power, once they have successfully overthrown the utterly corrupt and despicable tyrants? After all, doesn’t the group that finally wrests control, or their successors, eventually ossify into an oppressive regime? Absolute power corrupts absolutely, as the saying goes. And why should the author expend so much effort to build sympathy for a lawless elite, if they will only slide down the slippery slope into tyranny at the end of the story arc? Patrick Nielsen Hayden pointed out that even in the writings of Tolkein, the triumph of the righteous was only a brief respite in an otherwise unrelenting aeon of horror and oppression. So, as it turns out, according to the findings of this Boskone panel, the triumphant lawless elite will nevertheless have their brains eaten by each other or the nearest horde of zombies in the end. Though you probably want to edit out those last few pages. Next con I will take some notes or something, since this is all I can remember off the top of my head!

For those who didn’t experience it in the 70s, it’s hard to define the tremendous fervor and passion that Gerber aroused with his wise-cracking hero, Howard the Duck. Please take the time to read the tribute to Gerber at Comics Reporter, which really puts Gerber’s career into context. For me, scrabbling around in the high desert of Albuquerque, New Mexico, the arrival of Howard the Duck was like discovering an oasis of sanity in a world gone mad. For all the demagogues and sycophants, for all the control freaks and kidney ladies, suddenly we had a hot-tempered Duck who just wasn’t gonna take it any more! Howard’s campaign for President of the United States was literally the only ray of hope for America, after the moribund disaster of Nixon vs. McGovern in ‘72, Watergate, and the ugly realities of the campaign trail and the media’s hidden taskmasters that were so clearly brought into the open by Hunter S. Thompson. You will surely accuse me of spreading lies and apocryphal tales…but I’m telling you it’s Buddha’s honest truth: the first issue of Howard the Duck was so eagerly anticipated in Albuquerque, that some enterprising comic book dealers managed to hijack the shipment on it’s way to the distributor’s warehouse! While copies could be found bent and unwanted in Denver, tossed out with leftovers in Des Moines, and passed from hand to hand in Los Angeles, there was not a SINGLE COPY of Howard the Duck #1 to be purchased in Central New Mexico. Those sneaky bastards kept the whole lot of them and waited for issue #2 to hit the stands before “discovering” them - one at a time - and selling them to all of us duck-addicts. Back in those days, you could buy a FN+ copy of an original EC Weird Science book for $10, and those devil-spawn dealers were asking $8 or $10 each for Howard the Duck #1, which was barely off the press and selling all over the country for 25 cents. Well, hopefully they will roast in hell for that! Nonetheless, I can tell you that no matter how it was you got your hands on those comics, they really hit home. Gerber struck self-consciously ironic gold with Howard’s struggle against the “so-called” reality of Planet Earth. How many of us wayward souls at last found a kindred spirit in that foul-mouthed and soft-feathered wanderer? Too many of us to count, I’m sure! So let us doff our hats and think fondly of a brilliant mind, born into this mess that none of us made, and managed to inspire us with both laughter and dignified resistance.

You can see the complete set up for Diamond Bay Radio in the photo above. The basic necessities are the digital audio interface (an M-Audio Mobile Pre, which I got on Ebay for $80) and a decent vocal microphone (a Shure PG-48, also purchased on Ebay for $15). Since the Shure came with an XLR to 1/4&#8243; jack, I had to go to Cambridge Music and pick up a Whirlwind XLR to XLR cable. The Mobile Pre just looked like a better piece of gear than the Fast Track, and generally cost less than the similar models from Edirol, Tascam, etc; and also was the only model that boasted Windows drivers going back to Windows 2000. As it turned out the drivers did work on my Fujitsu lifebook, running Win2K. Once I had the drivers installed, and figured out how to turn on the input device monitor in Audacity, I was up and running! In fact, Audacity is so totally amazing, I was ripping some background music and recording separate voice tracks for the intro in minutes!

May’s life was both difficult and colorful, and his constant reinvention of himself as the protagonist of his own stories makes for some interesting reading. May’s most succesful series were those set in the American West, narrated by Winnetou, the Indian chief; and those set in the Ottoman Empire, narrated by Kara Ben Nemsi. Karl May went around masquerading as Kara Ben Nemsi…which makes me think of what would happen if all of today’s trekkies, furries, cosplayers, and LARPs carried their identities over into the workplace!

Everywhere we go, we are bombarded now by advertisements for drugs. These often take the form of overt manipulation. For those who are having a bad day, or have low self-esteem, these could trigger a whole chain of thoughts, a sort of self-reinforcing trap for which, SURPRISE! Drug companies have an ANSWER! And with the relaxation of restrictions on Direct to Consumer Drug advertising, this predatory form of brainwashing is reaching epidemic proportions. In Boston, Mass, a hot-bed of bio-medical research, one needs only to ride the subway to be subliminally assaulted by this nonsense. “Do you or anyone in your family feel irritable, drowsy, itch, hear sounds behind you, or have an occasional twitch in your leg muscles? You are very possibly suffering from IDIOT ON A TRAIN SYNDROME! If you are between the ages of 3 and 89 and have never been struck by lightning or bitten by sharks, you are qualified for a FREE TRIAL prescription testing routine at Mickey’s Bio Drug Laboratory. Call now, before you feel any WORSE!” An interesting book has been published on this topic, Inventing Disease and Pushing Pills, which predictably enough costs and arm and a leg! Unfortunately, the invention of disease is not limited to the absurdities of current so-called “Medical Research Trials,” we also have to deal with shocking evidence that pharmaceutical companies have historically been injecting us with vaccines which not only cause diseases over the long-term, but were in many cases laden with undetectable viruses. Of course, the sicker we all are, the more “cures” the drug companies can sell to us! Clearly, the pernicious tactics of the drug companies, which create worry and self-consciousness, are very similar to intended consequences of the police state. The only difference I can see are that the drug companies want to accentuate our sense of vulnerability in our physical being, while the police state wants to raise our sense of vulnerability in our behaviour. These are part and parcel of control apparatus. Apparently we are viewed as the equivalent of Pavlov’s dogs, leashed to television sets, fed neurotoxins and mutagenic substances, and repeatedly beaten down with threats to our well-being, our privacy, and even freedom of expression. Not good. If we look more closely at the Philip K. Dick statement above, we find that he had foreseen the whole mess rather clearly in his 1964 novel, The Simulacra: &#8216;The commercial, fly-sized, began to buzz out its message as soon as it managed to force entry. “Say! Haven’t you sometimes said to yourself, I’ll bet other people can see me! And you’re puzzled as to what to do about this serious, baffling problem of being conspicuous, especially -“ Chic crushed it with his foot.’ Here the advertisement is actually an annoying insect, which infiltrates the physical space of the protagonist, Chic Strikerock, and begins to infect him with self-doubts. Chic, correctly, gets rid of the nuisance…but the implication, perhaps, is that the robotic-insect is a mental construct, a self-induced agent of self-doubt. As Scott Bukatman comments in his fine book Terminal Identity: This annoying advertisement is a robot - a simulation of a life form… and it is worth noting the spiel of the advertisement, which invokes an anxiety over public appearance, thus contributing to the atomized, and therefore controlled and centralized, conditions of existence.“ Nonetheless, for all you weary travelers who might have read this far, keep in mind that there is no light ONLY if you choose to travel down their tunnel of self-defeat. Though there is a concentrated attempt to atomize us all, to divide us and set us up as beggars for relief from imaginary or corporate-inflicted maladies, there is no reason to simply give in to such manipulative blobbergosh. Turn off those brainwashing broadcasts, stay away from manufactured and highly processed foods, and focus on your own yogas to cleanse the body and to raise one’s level of consciousness.

Not a stone’s throw from the Leopold Gallery, where Gustav Klimt’s “Death and Life“ hangs beside the works of Kolo Moser, Egon Schiele, Herbert Ploberger &amp; Ernst Nepo, is the Mixer Comics vending machine. These mini-comics are appreciated far and wide, well at least as far as Serbia, where they got a nice mention at the GRRR! Comics Festival. Then again, you have to pause and wonder about how the town of Pancevo, Serbia can host such a mind-boggling comic art fest, when here in the atavistic U.S.A. we are only capable of an obscenely commercial ComicCon in San Diego, and the perfunctory nod to indy comics at APE. (Okay, I know, it must have something to do with Pancevo being the hometown of Alexander Zograf!) But in Vienna, they have a nice passageway dedicated to comics, with a strange mural on the arched ceiling. Anyway, in Vienna, I spend the majority of time in utter amazement in the painting galleries of Kunsthistorische Museum, so it was only by chance that I stumbled across a comic shop on the last day. This was a sort of funky shop, with piles of old digests like Perry Rhodan and El Pirata Negro. The prices were kind of high, so I only picked up a German reprint of Flash Gordon by Alex Raymond. When I went to Germany, I assumed that I would have to make a pilgrimage to Modern Graphics, near Kottbusser Tor in Berlin. But as it turns out, while I was attending a conference at Ruhr-University in Bochum, Sophia found the greatest comic shop downtown, Mr. C Comics! Run by the erstwhile and erudite Michael Koch, the visit to Mr. C Comics completely erased the need to visit Modern Graphics…which is to say, what a great place! Not only was I a happy customer buying a stack of comics there, but I discovered some cool things, like Nick the Space Traveller from 1958, by Hansrudi Wascher and Schwurbel by Calle Claus, not to mention some German editions of Jim Woodring comics and some really sick issues of Kranke. Having found all this great stuff, I was able to wander around other parts of Berlin, and found both great street art and another comic shop around Hackescher Market. So now another place to check out next time I’m in Berlin!

Directly across the street from the Sigmund Freud Museum was a second hand store where I scored this odd picture book for only 0.70 Euros. That night at the hotel they were airing television programs about the 50th anniversary of Sputnik&rsquo;s launch, which made the find even juicier. In addition to more than 40 pages of detailed histories of the early space race, the second half of the book features some really high quality black and white photos. For example, a curious picture shows Werhner Von Braun, age 18, carrying a rocket model on his shoulder out to the test launching pad&hellip; It looks as if Werhnie&rsquo;s shirt is a little mussed up from earlier tests&hellip;.So that&rsquo;s how it all started!Another intriguing shot depicts an early prototype spacesuit from 1952.

Halfway through the month, Japan has launched a new lunar orbiter, Kaguya, named after a mythical Princess born on the Moon. Is it a coincidence that Kaguya is also one of the most ubiquitous mythical characters to be reincarnated in Japanese Manga? What great cultural cross-over branding!

Now, the greenest tyro can download GoogleEarth, click on Sky, and begin scanning the heavens. Naturally, Google makes this easy and intuitive. They provide a simple menu of Celestial Objects to choose from, including the entire catalog of Messier objects, Yale Bright Stars, and the New General Catalog, all of which label themselves at appropriate levels. You really have to wonder if Google is not actually run by some sinister joint venture between the NSA and aliens from another galaxy. After all, they are doing a pretty good job of digitizing the entire corpus of human knowledge, while at the same time observing each mouse-click made by human beings and getting us ready for outer space! At any rate, I have to admit that the time-bar, which I am busily trying to implement for my own spatio-temporal geographic data, is totally cool when it comes to animating the positions of planets in the sky. You can set a “thickness” of the time bar, which creates a sort of streaming image trail, and then you can either drag the thickness along the width of the time-bar, or you can just do the lazy thing and click the animation button. Either way, you are in for a fun visual…the sort of thing that must have danced in the minds of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler when the rye bread they were chewing on tasted a little rusty! Google has also managed to embed fairly decent resolution images of various objects taken by the Hubble telescope. This makes for some spectacular browsing, if you have any interest in astronomy. These kids today…no more Elmer’s glue and stryofoam balls…just flick a mouse across the sky and away you go! GoogleEarth’s Sky is definitely not up to the gold-standard set by Stellarium, but it does provide a sort of “gateway drug” for people afraid of software.

These were big cardboard books with oval windows revealing part of a circular star chart that you would turn with your thumb. Lots of fun, though it meant a great deal of neck twisting and holding the chart up at arm’s length while trying to point a red-filtered flashlight upwards. Not to mention the fact that the resolution of the star chart provided little more than the major constellations as a guide, which we then supplemented with rapid reading of the Skyguide, Field Guide to the Heavens and Burnham’s Celestial Handbook. In terms of planetary astronomy, we were lucky if we could get a half decent solar system model to stay together long enough to display at school. You know, those things glued together from styrofoam balls and kebab sticks, and with Saturn’s rings portrayed by a lamentable pipe cleaner or sagging circle of construction paper. Now we can crank out images of our sister planets with X-Planet. Or, in a matter of seconds, we can install Stellarium, a virtual live-time planetarium! This software is fantastic! In the blink of a lunatic’s eye, we can use our up-down arrows on the keyboard to sail skywards, and the page up page down keys to zoom across inter-galactic space! Want to see the Dumbbell Nebula? Want to see Jupiter and it’s moons, all moving in the correct orbits - live time? Whoa, nelly! This stuff is amazing. On the other hand, with imagery like this, I’m afraid kids will not bother to go out and look at the hazy, smoggy, overlit sky.

There were two great consequences to being on the other side of the country from Sanjuro. First, he sent me his haiku poems. Drafts of haiku, finished haiku, published haiku, spontaneous haiku, unrequited love haiku…and all of these were some pretty good poems. Second, Sanjuro inspired me to write more poetry myself. Here’s one I wrote on 4 March 1990: full moon blinding me, I can’t see Daibutsu’s face! shadows black as ink.

He began the book as an attempt to round up a shit load of translations of Basho’s most famous haiku, “furuike ya kawazu tobikomu mizo no oto” - the old pond, the frog jumps in, sound of water. Well, Sato has one hundred translations of this old saw at the end of the book, so here’s my reply: only ripples now, neither a frog nor a splash, fly buzzes madly.“ Sanjuro has not only gone to the heart of Basho’s poem, but playing with the leftover resonance of the frog’s jump into the pond, he reduces them to ripples. Neither frog nor splash - [this is straight out of the &lt;a href=”http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231083610?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=diambayrese-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0231083610“ 0231083610?ie=”UTF8&amp;tag=diambayrese-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0231083610””&gt;Hui Neng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chinese Ch’an (Zen Buddhism). “Your body is a bodhi tree and your mind is like a mirror, you must wipe the mirror diligently and let no dust collect upon it,” said the famous Disciple of the Fifth Patriarch. To which Hui Neng replied: “There is no bodhi tree and there is no mirror! Where would the dust collect?”] Then, in conclusion, Sanjuro turns the stillness of the image on its head by introducing the irritating buzzing of the fly! This is Sanjuro’s famous kireji style, like the flashing steel of a Samurai sword that strikes before you even are aware of its existence! He then challenged me to compose a set of linked haiku, renga-style, in which we would take turns sparring with our poems. Here is Sanjuro’s magnificent opening: forsythia blooms fresh scent on moonlit breezes where are my damn shoes? and here are the subsequent rounds: lex 3-26-90 i came outside to shiver amid swaying silver blooms lex 5-15-90 like a waking dream i’m lost in the splashing sound soft and cool spring rain sanjuro 6-7-90 the hour is late, home is near rice boils madly in the pot sanjuro 11-5-87 full moon, wind-blown rain could this night be more perfect? where is the woman? lex 6-10-90 her hand, floating above mine… she knows too much about ghosts! lex 6-10-90 a whispering wind frees them all with one clean stroke white camellias sanjuro 6-28-90 petals swirl, branches snapping slapping of thighs on buttocks sanjuro 6-16-90 at the breaking dawn chirping of birds and crickets… which sound is more sweet? The last time I saw Sanjuro would have been in 1994, when I washed up in Seattle after my first sojourn in China. We ended up working as lowly clerks in Crown Bookstore, near the Northgate section of town. Somebody shattered the front door for no apparent reason, and we had our photo taken there, for evidence. In the intervening decade, I spent years in Japan, Amherst, Taiwan and Boston, but never could find Sanjuro again! Alas… The second great consequence of being far away was to receive Sanjuro’s absurd and fantastic Christmas cards every year. I have a set of these running from 1987 to 1995. The only years I am missing are 1988 (when I was blotto in Boston) and 1993 (when I was living in People’s Republic of China). I’m going to reproduce these here, for the first time anywhere, here are five samples of John C. Sanjuro Pray’s hand-tinted Christmas Cards! Wherever you are Sanjuro, vaya con dios, bro!

For example, the whole Brazilian Copacabana) theme, from Carmen Miranda and her wacky fruit hat, to Chiquita banana commercials, to some sort of totemic Caribbean dancer that still permeates our tiki-laden zeitgeist. (Interesting side-note, even though Copacabana page on Wikipedia has the totemic image, they don’t mention Carmen Miranda!) Anyway, I was thinking about the idiotic Monkees theme song, which pretty much runs through my head every morning as I walk under the ominous brimstone-reeking edifice of Harvard Law School - in particular the part where Peter Tork is in a wheeled bathtub scrubbing his back with a brush as the other Monkees push him along the street. And I thought, oh yeah, they just put that in there because they read Mr. Natural comix where Flakey Foont decides to spend the rest of his life in his bathtub. Eventually Flakey fixes up his tub with a motor and wheels and shows off to Mr. Natural, with predictable consequences! But then it hit me with a tremendous WHAAM! The Monkees Show was aired from 1966 to 68, at least one year BEFORE Robert Crumb drew the Mr. Natural episode with Flakey Foont’s bathtub escapade (dated 1969)! Ye Gads! Does that mean R. Crumb was recycling images from the Monkees! Then I started to think about it, and this eerie mind-warping sensation of the curvature of time and space took over my wobbling brain… Exactly where do memes begin, and what is their actual trajectory as they are recycled through pop culture? Where does the bathtub thing begin? Even the Cat-In-The-Hat was eating cake in a tub in 1957! A google revealed that there exists nothing less than a bathtub art museum featuring 100 years of bathtub fixations (okay, must be the nudity), and includes some very weird Scandinavians posing with their sport tubs. Clearly this is a topic worthy of further study! Should we go back to Diogenes and seek out washbasin allusions throughout history? Perhaps not tonight.

After swilling beer and munching seafood, you may want to stop for a rest at one of the fanciful hotels nearby, like the “International Hotel” with it’s curious facade. Of course Namba is not all nightlife… Down a nearby alley you will find people splashing water on the guardian figure of the Hozenji, which is completely covered in moss. [ ](http://www.dbr.nu/yunchtime/misc/osaka_hozenji_lg.jpg) And not far away is the National Bunraku Theatre, where we managed to catch the first 4 hours of the daily matinee. Bunraku puppet theatre exists somewhere in a supernatural space between Kabuki and Noh. The musical narration combined with plucking of the samisen transports the listener to a strange dimension where the puppeteers (who are standing in plain view), along with their assistants (inobtrusively poised under black hoods) all seem to vanish. We paid a visit to the Shitennoji Temple, admiring the gardens, five storey pagoda, active Buddhist services, and two splendid guardians. After days of slaking ourselves with ramen, udon, sushi and plenty of beer, we left by Haruka Express train to Kyoto. Naturally the first thing that greets you outside of Kyoto Station is a pillar surmounted by a rocket-booted Astroboy, soaring in front of a three-meter-tall super-high-definition video screen. Which was a harbinger of our discovery of the Kyoto International Manga Museum! Manga, Manga, Manga! An entire three-storey school was converted into the Manga Museum, its hallways and classrooms packed with what has got to be the world’s largest collection of manga under a single roof. Not only classic Japanese manga are here, but translations of comics from other countries, a cinema (where we watched some early stop-motion animation), and during the annual Manga Fest there are actual manga artists sketching away in various corners of the building. Totally amazing! (By the way, I must add that Astroboy is small beer compared to Prince Planet or Gigantor.) Well, I suppose I should say that Kyoto has some sights beyond Manga that are worth seeing. Noteable are the temples along the Path of the Philosophy, which stretches from Ginkakuji southward to Nanzenji. Somehow we managed to start off at Nanzenji where we stumbled onto a movie set. Since the actors in their costumes were getting most of the attention, I managed to spend some time meditating in a small shrine with a beautiful courtyard. After Nanzenji we rode the bus up to Ginkakuji and started walking south along the aforementioned path. After making our way along the path and visiting several Shinto shrines and Buddhist Temples, we finished up the day’s journey at Eikando Zenrinji . This is a perfect conclusion to a day of Temple-hopping in Kyoto, because there is hardly anyplace more beautiful than Zenrinji. Pristine gardens, fantastic painted screens, and polished wood patios provide a place to rest within the temple complex. Among the screens are a set of fantastic tigers painted by 17th Century artist Tanyu Kano. One of the shrine rooms holds a world famous sideways-glancing-Amida figure. Behind the main hall is a well where dripping water sounds like the vibrations of a plucked koto. Eikando Zenrinji is a serene and wonderful place. Far from the tranquility of the Buddhist temples, we also took in the final performance of a musical called Okuni é˜¿å›½, which was some kind manic collision between Kabuki history, Broadway camp, and theatre of the absurd. Mostly absurd. Imagine, if you will, some ghosts narrating a Josie and the Pussycats adventure, with cameo appearances by Richard Burton and Joel Gray, set at a frantic pace and with a mashup of choreography taken from either West Side Story or a suburban high school cheerleaders practice. Somehow the five curtain calls, standing ovation, flowers and teary farewells only made the four hours of madness more surreal. In any case, there is no place on earth you could witness anything so weird as the stage of Minamiza. After the show and some wandering among the hordes of Geisha spotters in Gion, we found the alleyway full of upscale Kyoto eateries along the Kamogawa that runs south from the Kyotoshi Yakushomae subway station on the Tozai line. We dined here two nights in a row, getting lucky both times and enjoying some amazing Kyoto style roast duck, sukiyaki, bamboo shoot soup, tempura, and other treats. It is not cricket to visit Kyoto without a sidetrip to Nara. This we managed easily by catching the appropriate train from the Karasuma Oike subway platform. It was a splendid day, slightly misting, and early enough to miss some of the hordes of uniformed school children that began to arrive by countless tour buses as the day progressed. Deer wandered in the park, around the park, basically everywhere…and they were badly in need of a deer-dip, if you know what I mean. Nonetheless, Todaiji, temple of the great Buddha, was magnificent. As was the outlook from the nearby Sangetsudo. Back in Kyoto, wandering around Gion, I found some amusing little cardboard buttons at an antique store. They must have seen me coming, because I shelled out 300 Yen for the little trinkets, just so I could scan them and post here: You’ve got to love the crazy oni devil on the left, who seems to have strayed out of a Lafcadio Hearn story and into an E.C. comic along the way. Meanwhile, it is a surprise to see that Richard Nixon was actually a kabuki performer. Though strange that his symbol is a fist, not a peace sign… but then, that must have been long before the *I am not a crook* thing. If anybody knows who that kid on the mechanical horse is, please let me know! We rounded off our fine dinners in Kyoto with a trip to the chain grill Izakaya Komakura. You can’t complain to the spread that can be had for 3000 Yen. Back when I lived in Japan (1994-1995) the same food would have cost 10,000 Yen, easy!","categories":[{"name":"TRAVELS","slug":"TRAVELS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/TRAVELS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Buddhism","slug":"Buddhism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/Buddhism/"},{"name":"comics","slug":"comics","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/comics/"}]},{"title":"Anti-Art School","slug":"anti-art-school","date":"2007-04-10T22:34:07.000Z","updated":"2017-10-19T00:15:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/anti-art-school/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/anti-art-school/","excerpt":"","text":"In case you dropped out of art school, or never had the chance to go, or if you are just a drunken bum who likes to draw - there is always Dr. Sketchy’s Anti-Art School.

Riding in on the airport bus, I decided to jump off randomly in the center of the city and make my way by foot to the Hilton. Typically I would stay at a cheap guesthouse, but Dru Gladney said he was staying there that night and I wanted to talk to him about the possibility of creating a gazetteer of Uighur placenames. What an interesting place Urumqi was! After checking in and failing to find Dru, I took a camera and a notebook and started wandering the streets. Walking south I eventually found a large botanical park, fronted by a very large nursery selling plants and clay pots of every description. After wandering back through the center of the town to the Xinhua Bookstore, where I purchased my usual pile of maps and atlases, I decided to try a roast mutton stand that caught my eye earlier in the day. The place turned out to be well worth the extra hike, and I feasted on a platter of roast mutton and fresh baked Central Asian round-bread with sesame. The fellow outside carving the lamb carcasses and tending the grill was a good sport about letting me take his picture hard at work.","text":"In late August 2001, I boarded a plane at Hongqiao airport in Shanghai and flew to Urumqi. Riding in on the airport bus, I decided to jump off randomly in the center of the city and make my way by foot to the Hilton. Typically I would stay at a cheap guesthouse, but Dru Gladney said he was staying there that night and I wanted to talk to him about the possibility of creating a gazetteer of Uighur placenames. What an interesting place Urumqi was! After checking in and failing to find Dru, I took a camera and a notebook and started wandering the streets. Walking south I eventually found a large botanical park, fronted by a very large nursery selling plants and clay pots of every description. After wandering back through the center of the town to the Xinhua Bookstore, where I purchased my usual pile of maps and atlases, I decided to try a roast mutton stand that caught my eye earlier in the day. The place turned out to be well worth the extra hike, and I feasted on a platter of roast mutton and fresh baked Central Asian round-bread with sesame. The fellow outside carving the lamb carcasses and tending the grill was a good sport about letting me take his picture hard at work. Later I did catch up with Dru and his colleague Wang Jianhua, from the Beijing Minorities University. The following day I did some serious wandering around Urumqi, enjoying the sights and sounds of the Uighur neighborhoods. My prize for the day was a cassette tape of what could only be called a modern Uighur band, playing guitars and traditional percussion instruments, called “Gypsy Renao” in English. (This tape lasted me many years, but sadly fell apart before I had the sense to get a digital copy archived.) The amusing thing about the tape, was that I went into a small local restaurant for dinner, about the time of early evening when I needed some fuel and to take the load off my worn out feet. The proprietors were almost thunderstruck that I appeared in their doorway. Apparently they had never had a foreign customer before, being such an out-of-the-way little dive. They valiantly tried to show me that they only had a menu in Chinese, but when I explained that Chinese was fine they brightened up and wiped down a table for me. No sooner had I seated myself then a whisper went back to the kitchen and everyone emerged, from cook to grandma to neighbors. They were all greeting me like a long lost relative. And then suddenly the waitress started to rifle through my bag. She seemed so friendly and natural about it, I didn’t even complain and just watched her with curiosity as she examined my things. A cellphone, a notebook full of sketches, a bag of raisins, etc. But when she found the tape she cried out and laughed merrily and then immediately ripped it open and put it in the cassette player. What followed was basically a bunch of dancing and drinking and incredible merriment, punctuated by spells of sitting and tea drinking, and eventually me eating a plate of vegetables. I tell, you I regretted not having come to Xinjiang much sooner…in a previous lifetime for example! Early the next morning I flew to Kashgar and made my way to the Seman Hotel. I took a shared room with a fellow from Ireland who had come to Kashgar for an emergency appendix removal. Why Kashgar? It was the cheapest place he could find in China when his appendix burst. And then, as he recuperated in the hotel, he fell in love with the city and repeatedly asked for medical extensions of his visa. Not far from the hotel, down delightful alleyways full of knife vendors, cloth merchants, and fix-it shops, is the Yellow Mosque, which is also surrounded by a splendid labyrinthine bazaar. Neatly stacked were carafes for tea, round breads, gourds, rice bowls, knives, prayer beads and what have you, nicely draped by colorful awnings. I discovered a talkative girl at the ceramics shop, and she quickly introduced me to her brothers, and aunts, and cousins, etc. They were all quite curious and charming and splendid people, and as it turned out the lot of them living on the income of selling a few teacups and plates every day. I had picked out two blue rice bowls, encrusted with red Arabic script, and when I asked to buy them I decided to get another half dozen more. A meaningless pittance, and an extra weight of breakables in my luggage…but somehow necessary all the same. But I do wish them well, and who could not, with such generous smiles for a stranger’s camera. My exploration of Kashgar included the Provincial Museum (where the pit latrine is NOT recommended to visit), as well as the main shopping district, the Apa Khoja Tomb and the Sunday Bazaar. Highlights of the Bazaar were the preparation of mo-mo dumplings in front of the teahouse, where I sat on the second floor drinking tea and cracking pistachios. And watching an elderly gentleman very carefully trying the fit of a pair of socks on his granddaughter’s feet as she savored an iced treat of some sort. Not to mention the negotiations that went on over the quality and prices of some fruit. The much sought after rustic feel of Kashgar was everywhere to be seen and experienced, from the donkey carts slowly taking up the entire alleyway, to the shops full of strangely shining furnitures. How often can we have an experience of a place that so closely matches the images evoked in books from long ago, like Macartney at Kashgar? Still the unquestionable highlight of the trip was a trip to Tashkurgan County in a rented jeep. It took me three hours to find a jeep and a driver willing to take me there (despite the fact that the road was considered closed due to washouts). Then it took me three days to find two more travellers wiling to split the rental fee. We took off before dawn and made our way through the suburbs where playing children seemed to run laughing from beneath the very wheels of the speeding jeep. After four of five hours, with the sun up for over an hour, we stopped at a sort of truck stop, where an open metal wok of what looked like black jelly was slowly being heated up over a burning lump of soft coal. In the back, mo mo were just going into the steamer rack. Our driver indicated that this was the last solid food to be had before our objective: Karakul, the mystical lake at the foot of two of the world’s mightiest peaks - Mount Mustagh and Mount Gongar. We waited close on forty minutes for the mo-mo to steam, at which point I was asked if we wanted to eat a bowl of soup with them, meaning the brackish sludge that had slowly started to bubble in the giant roadside wok. My fellow sojourners quickly declined, but after a few sniffs I decided to try my luck on what was no doubt a muttony stew, full of garlic and pepper. No sooner had I dipped the mo mo into that fatty residue and taken a bite did I discover that it was simply the most fantastic thing I’d ever tasted. Somehow the age, the oil, the pepper, the strands of dry and yet tender mutton made the plain mo mo into a feast for caravanseries of kings! Yum. And after that many hours of passing through rocky canyons, alongside the sea of sand, then up around the massif of Gongar where glaciers were piled thicker than honey in baklava, until we emerged on the plateau of the Lake. Karakul! Only when you finally stand there, gazing up from the bored camels and donkeys standing next to a few shacks, can you possibly encompass such a vision with your own mind. A crystal blue lake, Karakul, raised half way to the sky, and fed by the collosal mountains on both sides. My two companions and I decided to hike away from the local touts, along the lake to the foothills at the south. Along the way we crossed some feeder streams, along with locals: yaks. Then we perched on a slight outcrop facing the lake, and sliced open the Hami melon that I insisted on toting with me the entire way from the market of Kashgar. Sitting next to a small chorten, with sweet Hami juice running down our chins, the brilliant sun burning our skins to a crisp (we found out soon!), and a knife stuck into the remaining melon…we sat in silence, listening to the breeze blowing across the lake and watching the clouds sweep raggedly from peak to peak. There is no word for that kind of paradise, but I nonetheless thank all the spirits of our planet earth that Karakul is still so damned difficult to visit! On my way home, I packed up my bundle of knives and rice bowls, and wondered when I might ever be lucky enough to return to Xinjiang.","categories":[{"name":"TRAVELS","slug":"TRAVELS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/TRAVELS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Xinjiang","slug":"Xinjiang","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/Xinjiang/"}]},{"title":"eBug to the future!","slug":"ebug-to-the-future","date":"2007-03-31T20:25:56.000Z","updated":"2017-10-18T23:01:05.000Z","comments":true,"path":"MACHINES/ebug-to-the-future/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/MACHINES/ebug-to-the-future/","excerpt":"","text":"kudos to Mr. Murphy, inventor of the electronic vehicle, eBug!","categories":[{"name":"MACHINES","slug":"MACHINES","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/MACHINES/"}],"tags":[{"name":"transport","slug":"transport","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/transport/"}]},{"title":"need to know basis","slug":"need-to-know-basis","date":"2007-03-31T20:24:34.000Z","updated":"2017-10-18T20:55:12.000Z","comments":true,"path":"IDEAS/need-to-know-basis/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/IDEAS/need-to-know-basis/","excerpt":"","text":"dvorak has done some homework for us on what we need to know in the 21st century. thanks dvo!","categories":[{"name":"IDEAS","slug":"IDEAS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/IDEAS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"futurism","slug":"futurism","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/futurism/"},{"name":"memes","slug":"memes","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/memes/"}]},{"title":"British Sci-Fi pop art of Ron Turner","slug":"british-sci-fi-pop-art-of-ron-turner","date":"2007-03-31T20:17:37.000Z","updated":"2017-10-18T20:55:12.000Z","comments":true,"path":"ARTS/british-sci-fi-pop-art-of-ron-turner/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/ARTS/british-sci-fi-pop-art-of-ron-turner/","excerpt":"","text":"a fun filled flickr gallery of classic Vargo Statten covers, and many others.","categories":[{"name":"ARTS","slug":"ARTS","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/categories/ARTS/"}],"tags":[{"name":"illustration","slug":"illustration","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/illustration/"},{"name":"science fiction","slug":"science-fiction","permalink":"http://www.yunchtime.net/tags/science-fiction/"}]}]}
